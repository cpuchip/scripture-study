## Working on
- **★ P1 EXTRACTION UNDERWAY (kicked off 2026-06-12, Michael's "Lets kick off P1!"):**
  (1) `github.com/cpuchip/pg-ai-stewards-workspace` (PRIVATE) created at
  `projects/pg-ai-stewards-workspace/` — skeleton + covenant/intent overlay
  copies + 241-file classification (`overlays/classification.tsv`: 191 core /
  17 core-p2 / 27+1 overlay / 5 mixed / 1 scratch) + 33-entry overlay manifest
  + all overlay migrations populated. (2) OSS extension layer extracted
  (`3d8229d`): src/*.rs audited, lib.rs chain reworked (4 seed embeds removed),
  189 core + 5 SPLIT migrations, 193-entry core manifest, bundle = build
  artifact (never checked in). **Build GREEN + virgin CREATE EXTENSION proven**
  (scratch container, 0 workspace seeds leaked) → OSS pushed through journal.
  **COUNCIL (same evening, all ratified):** ct2 RETIRED live · ledger
  leave-and-map · seed pack one-lineage (jumpstart kit canonical) ·
  **doc_*** (study_* tools → doc_*, studies → docs, scripture_anchor →
  values_anchor) · **cutover = FRESH REBUILD** (no shims; selective import;
  live volume archived; rename map at workspace parity/rename-map.tsv).
  **EVENING COUNCIL (all Michael-ratified):** doc_* · fresh-rebuild cutover ·
  six rebuild lessons (early mismatch classification, verify→tests/, _kind
  enum, stewards.config, CI day-one, backup+offsite WAL tiers) ·
  compact_context PULLED IN (hold lifted) · **drop AGE** (relational edges;
  N-depth + BUILDS_ON lineage; fast-at-scale + tenancy conditions; prior art
  verified incl. gospel-engine itself) · **consolidated authored chain**
  ("dave wins"). All in extraction-plan.md.
  **DAEMON LEG SHIPPED (`3561cec`):** five binaries (bridge, stewards-cli,
  persona-host, fs-read-mcp, stewards cockpit) → ONE module
  github.com/cpuchip/pg-ai-stewards; go.work knot dead; build+vet+smoke
  green. Local builds need GOWORK=off (nested clone; strangers unaffected).
  **★ STEWARDSHIP GRANT (Michael, 2026-06-12 night, recorded in
  extraction-plan §Stewardship grant):** full P1-P2 build + migration under
  agent stewardship (act/act+report). Hinge list (still his): ① the CUT
  itself (live stack stop + persona moves) ② coder-mcp public-ship nod
  after hardening review ③ 30-sec data-import confirmation at cut
  (default: corpus/covenant/intent/yt import, histories archive).
  compact_context defaults = his sketch (between-turn, judge-pattern,
  cheap compactor). OSS persona keys: self-service attempt, ping if gated.
  **AUTHORING LEG ACTIVE:** blueprint at
  `pg-ai-stewards-oss/.spec/proposals/authoring-blueprint.md` (consolidation
  map, rename rules, batch plan B1-B6, core=100%-bundle decision).
  **B1a SHIPPED (`3602500`):** 00-config.sql (stewards.config + seeds) +
  01-graph.sql (nodes/edges + recursive-CTE walks) in the bundle chain;
  virgin boot + CYCLE-TERMINATION + bidirectional/lineage walks all proven
  on scratch. rename-map.tsv seeded in workspace repo (parity/).
  **B1b SHIPPED (`ed0da94` + workspace `22e5ea1`) — B1 COMPLETE, AGE IS
  OUT OF THE IMAGE:** create_studies→create_docs (6a + h3-1-docs-half
  ABSORBED into the table: file_path nullable, tags/source_type/
  project_association; kind default 'doc'); 02-workstreams.sql re-authors
  2-6a/b/c relational (context_for = ONE recursive CTE; context_for_hop +
  ensure_studies_graph DELETED; todos parent kinds lowercased
  workstream|doc|todo, 'Phase' retired); resolver/similarity/doc_show
  renamed + relational (doc_similar pure SQL); Dockerfile stage-2 AGE
  build DELETED (runtime = plain pgvector); doc_* swept through ALL chain
  + replay files AND Go daemons (MCP tools study_search/get/similar/
  citations→doc_*; doc_history found by virgin assertion sweep);
  rename-map grew ~27 rows. VERIFIED: virgin CREATE EXTENSION with age
  NOT AVAILABLE (0 in pg_available_extensions), 0 study% functions,
  import/citations/declared-edges/todos/phases/context_for walk/doc_show/
  doc_search/doc_get all smoke green; go build+vet green (GOWORK=off).
  Blueprint gaps fixed: h3-1 mapped (work_items half → 04), 6a removed
  from 04 sources; audit notes in blueprint (parse_gospel_links
  genericization, embed-config at B5, watchman study_id cols at B2,
  l6 wrapper names at B4).
  **NEXT = B2** (03-watchman..07-steward per blueprint §Batch plan):
  consolidate 2-7a/3a/2-7b1-b4 → 03-watchman.sql (rename watchman tables'
  study_id cols → doc_id + rename-map rows), 3c1/3c2/3c2-5/3c3core/
  3c3-1/3c3-3/3c3-5/i1-i3/h3-1(work_items)/h3-followup-2 → 04-work-items,
  3e2-1/2/3core/h1-5a/h1-7a → 05-mcp-bridge, cost files → 06, steward →
  07. Verification loop per batch (build → virgin scratch → assertions →
  commit). Then B3-B6.
  (3) Private manifest REPAIRED (root `e5ccc0c3`): 9 live-applied migrations
  (r11-r17, ct2-5, ct2-7e) restored from ledger order; found the runner is
  LEXICAL + manifest-blind (replayed scratch-ct2-run2 into live 06-10 —
  codewright-ct2 rows; disposition = Michael's call).
- **pg-ai-stewards OSS extraction** (continues the `pg-ai-stewards-oss` lane —
  same session, retitled): spec RATIFIED, Apache-2.0 FINAL (`3c43d4e`).
  **"Anatomy of a Turn" SHIPPED (`0e8c3c9`)** + order-research update +
  2026 regrounding (`1a604af`). **Cutover gate AMENDED (`8662448`,
  ratified 06-12): FULL PARITY before the cut** — coder-mcp + UI become
  pre-cutover (P2 before cut), 20 mismatches + ledger wart now on the
  cutover critical path. Next: P1 extraction (task #151), side-by-side
  compose (`stewards-oss-*`, 55434/8081/8091). Overlay design ratified
  (`0e01a04`): private repo pg-ai-stewards-workspace, created at P1
  kickoff. jumpstart-crossover reflection seeded (`48864a47`, no build).
- **PR.1 SHIPPED + live-verified 2026-06-12** (inbox assignment, Michael's
  "best of your judgement" grant): covenants.extensions catch-all +
  presiding render + Watch echo; reseed through the real path; smoke
  `600f6673` ACK with presiding terms in the dispatched payload. Journal:
  `projects/pg-ai-stewards/.spec/journal/2026-06-12-pr1-covenant-extensions.md`.
  Carry-forwards there: walls-vs-compulsion audit (§V), trailing-reminder
  proposal, verify-suite full run, ledger naming wart.
- **compact_context SEED captured** (Michael's sketch, 2026-06-12 — HOLD,
  no build until council): commissioned-curation side quest; seed at
  `projects/pg-ai-stewards/.spec/proposals/substrate-compact-context-sidequest.md`
  with parked council questions. 2026 research also on hold per Michael.

## Claims
- NONE live. (PR.1 window CLOSED 2026-06-12: pg+bridge rebuilt/restarted,
  watchman resumed, queue clean, live smoke verified. Persona-host
  container was never touched.)
- The general-workspase lane owns the containerized persona-host
  (acknowledged; will not restart it).

## Handoffs / notes
- 2026-06-12: Anatomy doc is public — sibling sessions citing substrate
  architecture can link github.com/cpuchip/pg-ai-stewards/blob/main/docs/anatomy-of-a-turn.md.
- Supersedes lane file `pg-ai-stewards-oss.md` (same session_id; hook
  re-claimed under the new title).
