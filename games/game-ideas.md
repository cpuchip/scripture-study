# Gospel-Centered Game Ideas

*Exploring how game mechanics can teach eternal principles*

---

## The Vision

Create games that:
1. **Teach** gospel principles through play, not just theme
2. **Feel** genuinely fun (not "church-y" in a forced way)
3. **Spark** gospel conversations naturally
4. **Scale** from simple to complex

---

## Part 1: Game Mechanics That Mirror Gospel Principles

### 1. Progression Systems — "Grace for Grace"

**Gospel Principle:** 
> "And he received not of the fulness at first, but continued from **grace to grace**, until he received a fulness."  
> — [D&C 93:13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)

**Game Mechanics:**
- **Leveling up** — Character growth over time
- **Skill trees** — Choices that shape who you become
- **Experience points** — Small actions accumulate into transformation
- **Unlockable abilities** — New powers come with growth

**Design Insight:** Unlike many games where you start weak and become overpowered, a gospel game could emphasize that *growth never ends* and that helping others level up is as important as your own progression.

---

### 2. Covenant Mechanics — "If/Then" Promises

**Gospel Principle:**
> "I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise."  
> — [D&C 82:10](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/82.md)

**Game Mechanics:**
- **Contracts/Pacts** — Agree to conditions, receive benefits
- **Loyalty systems** — Commitment unlocks deeper rewards
- **Two-way obligations** — Both parties have responsibilities
- **Breaking covenants** — Consequences for abandonment

**Design Insight:** Covenants in games could be voluntary agreements that *constrain* some choices but *unlock* greater power. The constraint IS the feature, not a bug.

---

### 3. Light and Darkness — "That Which Is of God Is Light"

**Gospel Principle:**
> "And that which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness."  
> — [D&C 50:23](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.md)

**Game Mechanics:**
- **Visibility/fog of war** — Light reveals truth
- **Corruption mechanics** — Darkness spreads if unchecked
- **Torch/lantern resources** — Light requires maintenance
- **Safe zones** — Places of refuge and clarity

**Design Insight:** Darkness isn't just "evil"—it's *ignorance*. Light mechanics could reveal information, show the true nature of things, and dispel deception.

---

### 4. Agency and Consequence — "Free to Choose"

**Gospel Principle:**
> "Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh... and they are **free to choose liberty and eternal life** ... or to choose captivity and death."  
> — [2 Nephi 2:27](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.md)

**Game Mechanics:**
- **Branching narratives** — Choices shape the story
- **Karma systems** — Actions have lasting effects
- **Reputation** — NPCs remember your choices
- **Multiple endings** — Where you end reflects who you became

**Design Insight:** The best agency systems make *both* paths feel like genuine choices with real appeal—just like the tree of life vs. the great and spacious building.

---

### 5. Cooperative Building — "Zion"

**Gospel Principle:**
> "And the Lord called his people Zion, because they were of **one heart and one mind**, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was **no poor among them**."  
> — [Moses 7:18](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)

**Game Mechanics:**
- **Cooperative win conditions** — Everyone wins together or not at all
- **Resource sharing** — Pooling for the common good
- **Asymmetric abilities** — Each player has unique gifts needed by all
- **Anti-hoarding mechanics** — Blessing others benefits yourself

**Design Insight:** Most games reward competition. A Zion game could make *lifting others* the winning strategy.

---

### 6. Sacrifice — "Lay Down Your Life"

**Gospel Principle:**
> "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man **lay down his life** for his friends."  
> — [John 15:13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/john/15.md)

**Game Mechanics:**
- **Giving up resources** for others' benefit
- **Self-limiting choices** that help the team
- **Trading present power for future blessing**
- **Protecting weaker players** at personal cost

**Design Insight:** Sacrifice mechanics where giving away power *feels good* and is strategically smart.

---

### 7. Faith — "Acting Without Perfect Knowledge"

**Gospel Principle:**
> "Faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye **hope for things which are not seen, which are true**."  
> — [Alma 32:21](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.md)

**Game Mechanics:**
- **Hidden information** — Acting on incomplete knowledge
- **Investment before payout** — Planting seeds, trusting growth
- **Risk/reward** — Stepping into the unknown
- **Trust mechanics** — Relying on other players

**Design Insight:** Faith mechanics could reward *acting* on belief before seeing results—the opposite of "wait and see."

---

### 8. Stewardship — "The Parable of the Talents"

**Gospel Principle:**
> "For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath."  
> — [Matthew 25:29](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/matt/25.md)

**Game Mechanics:**
- **Resource management** — Use it or lose it
- **Multiplication through use** — Active resources grow
- **Accountability** — End-game scoring based on stewardship
- **Delegation** — Entrusting resources to others

**Design Insight:** Resources that *grow when used* and *shrink when hoarded*.

---

### 9. Repentance — "A Broken Heart"

**Gospel Principle:**
> "And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit."  
> — [3 Nephi 9:20](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.md)

**Game Mechanics:**
- **Reset/restart options** — Second chances
- **Debt forgiveness** — Grace mechanics
- **Course correction** — Changing direction mid-game
- **Healing from mistakes** — Recovery paths

**Design Insight:** Unlike most games where mistakes are punished, repentance mechanics could allow genuine recovery—but require the player to *choose* to turn back.

---

### 10. Opposition — "Opposition in All Things"

**Gospel Principle:**
> "For it must needs be, that there is an **opposition in all things**."  
> — [2 Nephi 2:11](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.md)

**Game Mechanics:**
- **Push/pull dynamics** — Opposing forces create tension
- **Trade-offs** — Can't have everything at once
- **Risk** — Meaningful choices have stakes
- **Adversary systems** — Challenge that creates growth

**Design Insight:** A game without opposition is boring. The gospel teaches opposition is *necessary*—so should our games.

---

## Part 2: Game Concepts

### Concept A: "Line Upon Line" (Card Game)

**Type:** Deck-building card game (2-4 players, 30-45 min)

**Core Mechanic:** Players build a "testimony" deck by acquiring truth cards. Cards have *synergies*—they become more powerful when combined with related truths.

**Gospel Connection:**
- Start with basic principles (faith, repentance)
- Add deeper doctrines that *amplify* earlier ones
- "Milk before meat" — advanced cards require prerequisites
- Helping other players learn truths gives you bonuses

**Win Condition:** Cooperative — build collective understanding before darkness covers the land.

**Simple Version:** Could be played with a standard deck of cards with a reference sheet.

---

### Concept B: "The Strait Path" (Board Game)

**Type:** Journey board game (2-6 players, 45-60 min)

**Core Mechanic:** Players travel from the Tree of Life (Lehi's dream) while helping others. The path is narrow, temptations pull you aside, and the mists of darkness obscure choices.

**Gospel Connection:**
- The Iron Rod (scriptures) reveals the true path
- Great and spacious building offers shortcuts (that aren't)
- Mist events hide the board—only the rod shows the way
- Players can form "chains" (holding hands) to guide lost players

**Win Condition:** Everyone reaches the tree, or no one truly wins.

**Physical Components:** Simple board, cards for events, tokens for players.

---

### Concept C: "Stewards" (Resource Management Game)

**Type:** Engine-building game (2-5 players, 30-45 min)

**Core Mechanic:** Each player receives talents (resources) and must multiply them through service. Resources *decay* if hoarded but *multiply* when given to others.

**Gospel Connection:**
- Parable of the Talents as core mechanic
- Burying talents causes loss
- Giving away talents generates more for everyone
- End-game: return your stewardship and account for increase

**Twist:** The "Master" (game system) rewards based on *what you gave away*, not what you kept.

---

### Concept D: "Light the World" (Cooperative Card Game)

**Type:** Simple cooperative game (2-4 players, 15-20 min)

**Core Mechanic:** Darkness spreads on a shared board. Players play Light cards to push back darkness and illuminate cities/homes. 

**Gospel Connection:**
- "Ye are the light of the world"
- Individual lights combine to create greater illumination
- Some cards can only be played when others have already added light
- Darkness isn't evil—it's absence of light

**Perfect For:** Families, primary-age kids, quick play sessions.

---

### Concept E: "Covenant Path" (Pen & Paper RPG)

**Type:** Narrative role-playing game (3-6 players, ongoing)

**Core Mechanic:** Players create characters who make covenants. Covenants grant abilities but require specific behaviors. Breaking a covenant has consequences; renewing requires repentance.

**Gospel Connection:**
- Covenant theology becomes gameplay
- Character growth through promise-keeping
- Missions of service, not violence
- Cooperative problem-solving

**Setting Options:**
- Book of Mormon era (Nephi's journey, Ammon's mission)
- Pioneer trek
- Modern missionary experiences
- Abstract/fantasy world with gospel principles

---

### Concept F: "Seeds of Faith" (Simple Video Game)

**Type:** Incremental/idle game or simple puzzle game

**Core Mechanic:** Plant seeds (small acts of faith). Nurture them with attention. They grow over time, eventually bearing fruit that becomes new seeds.

**Gospel Connection:**
- Alma 32 — faith as a seed
- Small and simple things bring about great things
- Patience required — can't rush growth
- Neglected seeds wither

**Platform:** Web browser, mobile, or simple PC game.

---

## Part 3: Pen & Paper Quick Games

### "Scripture Chase Challenge"

**Players:** 2+  
**Supplies:** Scriptures (physical or digital), paper, pen

**Gameplay:**
1. One player gives a gospel topic or question
2. Other players race to find a relevant scripture
3. Points for speed AND quality of connection
4. Bonus: Explain how it applies to the topic

**Why It Works:** Gamifies scripture familiarity without trivializing content.

---

### "Parable Builder"

**Players:** 3-6  
**Supplies:** Index cards, pen

**Gameplay:**
1. Draw a gospel principle card (e.g., "Repentance," "Faith," "Service")
2. Each player writes a modern parable teaching that principle
3. Read aloud and vote on most effective
4. Discuss what made parables work

**Why It Works:** Teaches by creating, not just receiving.

---

### "What Would You Do?"

**Players:** 2+  
**Supplies:** Scenario cards (make your own)

**Gameplay:**
1. Draw a scenario card with a moral dilemma
2. Each player writes their response privately
3. Reveal and discuss choices
4. No "winning"—just thoughtful conversation

**Why It Works:** Practices agency in a safe environment.

---

## Part 4: Design Principles for Gospel Games

### 1. Mechanics Should Teach

The *rules themselves* should embody principles. Don't just slap a gospel theme on a standard game—make the gameplay *feel* like the doctrine.

**Example:** If teaching cooperation, make helping others the winning strategy, not just a nice option.

### 2. Fun First

If it's not fun, no one will play it twice. Gospel games must compete with *all* games for attention.

### 3. Not Preachy

Let the mechanics do the teaching. Avoid heavy-handed messaging. Trust players to make connections.

### 4. Multiple Depths

A great gospel game works for:
- Kids playing casually
- Teens competing strategically  
- Adults discussing gospel implications afterward

### 5. Accessible

Simple rules, minimal components, quick to teach. The best games are the ones that actually get played.

---

## Part 5: Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Prototype "Light the World"** — Simplest concept, good for testing
2. **Design "Line Upon Line" card list** — What truths? What synergies?
3. **Write "Covenant Path" core rules** — Basic RPG framework

### Questions to Explore

- What gospel principles are *hardest* to gamify?
- How do we handle "dark" elements (sin, Satan) respectfully?
- Can a game teach without the player realizing they're learning?
- What existing games already teach gospel principles accidentally?

### Games That Already Teach Gospel Principles

| Game | Principle It Teaches |
|------|---------------------|
| **Pandemic** | Cooperative sacrifice, working together |
| **Hanabi** | Trust, communication, faith in others |
| **Spirit Island** | Stewardship, defending the vulnerable |
| **Wingspan** | Creation appreciation, ecosystem interdependence |
| **Settlers of Catan** | Resource management, trading, community building |
