# Game Mechanics Research for Gospel Game Design

*Research into existing games to identify mechanics that could teach gospel principles*

---

## Research Methodology

This document analyzes popular games to understand their core mechanics and identify how those mechanics could parallel or teach gospel principles. The goal is to find mechanics that **teach through gameplay itself**, not just through theme or flavor text.

Key question for each game: *What does the mechanic teach players to value, and how does that connect to eternal principles?*

## Uno

### Game Overview
- **Designer:** Merle Robbins (1971)
- **Players:** 2-10
- **Time:** ~30 minutes
- **Complexity:** 1.10/5

### Core Mechanics
1. **Hand Management** - Managing which cards to play and when
2. **Matching** - Playing cards that match color or number
3. **Take That** - Direct player interaction (Skip, Reverse, Draw 2/4)
4. **Shedding** - Race to empty your hand

### How It Plays
Players attempt to be the first to empty their hand by playing cards that match the color or number on the discard pile. Special cards allow players to skip others, reverse play direction, or force opponents to draw cards. When you have one card left, you must say "UNO!" or face a penalty.

### Gospel Principle Connections

#### Weak Connections
| Mechanic | Potential Principle | Why It's Weak |
|----------|--------------------| --------------|
| Racing to empty hand | "Going out" / finishing | Purely competitive, no redemption |
| Take That cards | Opposition in all things? | Actually teaches attacking others |
| Matching | Following patterns | Very surface-level connection |

#### Analysis
Uno is primarily a **competitive, luck-based game** with strong "take that" elements. The mechanics encourage:
- Looking for ways to harm opponents
- Hiding information (not saying UNO)
- Racing against others

**Gospel Design Problem:** The core loop rewards attacking others and emphasizes luck over growth. There's no progression, no building, no redemption.

**What Could Be Salvaged:**
- The "UNO" call mechanic (announcing status) could parallel covenant declaration
- The matching mechanic could work for "following patterns" in a different context

### Verdict: Low Gospel Mechanic Potential
The mechanics themselves don't naturally teach gospel principles. Any gospel game would need to substantially modify or replace Uno's core systems.

## Splendor

### Game Overview
- **Designer:** Marc André (2014)
- **Players:** 2-4
- **Time:** ~30 minutes
- **Complexity:** 1.78/5
- **Awards:** Spiel des Jahres Nominee 2014, Golden Geek Winner

### Core Mechanics
1. **Set Collection** - Gathering gems to purchase cards
2. **Engine Building** - Cards provide permanent gem bonuses
3. **Contracts/Goals** - Noble tiles provide bonus points for achievements
4. **Open Drafting** - Taking resources visible to all players
5. **Race** - First to 15 points triggers endgame

### How It Plays
Players collect gem tokens to purchase development cards. Each card gives a permanent gem bonus, making future purchases cheaper. Nobles visit players who meet specific card combinations. First to 15 prestige points wins.

### Gospel Principle Connections

#### Strong Connections

| Mechanic | Gospel Principle | How It Teaches |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Engine Building** | Grace for Grace, Line upon Line | Each investment makes future progress easier—mirrors how obedience opens doors to more light |
| **Permanent Bonuses** | Eternal Progress | Gains are never lost; what you build persists |
| **Nobles Visiting** | Blessings Follow Obedience | Meeting requirements attracts recognition/blessing |
| **Resource Management** | Stewardship | Limited resources require wise allocation |
| **Planning Ahead** | Faith Acting on the Future | Must invest now for future capability |

#### Deep Dive: The Engine Building Mechanic

Splendor's most powerful gospel mechanic is **engine building**:

1. **Early game:** Everything is expensive, progress is slow
2. **Mid game:** Previous investments compound, progress accelerates  
3. **Late game:** What once seemed impossible becomes easy

This perfectly mirrors [D&C 130:18-19](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.md):
> "Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection. And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come."

**The mechanic itself teaches:** Early obedience compounds. Small investments in righteousness create capacity for greater righteousness.

#### Potential Modifications for Gospel Game
- **Gems → Virtues:** Faith, Hope, Charity, Knowledge, etc.
- **Cards → Blessings/Covenants:** Each covenant unlocks capacity
- **Nobles → Spiritual Gifts:** Visit when certain combinations are achieved
- **Points → Light/Intelligence:** Accumulating eternal progress

### Verdict: High Gospel Mechanic Potential ★★★★☆
Engine building naturally teaches eternal progression. The "compounding investment" feel mirrors how small daily choices build eternal capacity.

## Azul

### Game Overview
- **Designer:** Michael Kiesling (2017)
- **Players:** 2-4
- **Time:** 30-45 minutes
- **Complexity:** 1.78/5
- **Awards:** Spiel des Jahres Winner 2018

### Core Mechanics
1. **Open Drafting** - Select all tiles of one color from a factory
2. **Pattern Building** - Place tiles in rows to complete patterns
3. **End Game Bonuses** - Rewards for completing rows, columns, colors
4. **Risk/Reward (Penalty)** - Excess tiles cause negative points
5. **Grid Coverage** - Filling spaces according to constraints

### How It Plays
Players take turns drafting colored tiles from factory displays. All tiles of one color must be taken and placed in a pattern row. Complete rows transfer tiles to the wall for points. Tiles that can't be placed go to the floor line and cause penalties. Bonus points for completing rows, columns, and color sets.

### Gospel Principle Connections

#### Strong Connections

| Mechanic | Gospel Principle | How It Teaches |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Pattern Building** | Following Divine Patterns | Must match the template exactly—like ordinances |
| **Open Drafting** | Agency with Consequences | Choices visible to all; what you take affects what's available |
| **Penalty for Excess** | Taking More Than Needed | Over-commitment without capacity causes harm |
| **Completion Bonuses** | Enduring to the End | Partial rows score nothing; must complete |
| **Planning Around Others** | Community Impact | Your choices affect everyone's options |

#### Deep Dive: The Pattern Building Mechanic

Azul's wall has a **fixed pattern**—tiles must go in specific places. This mechanic teaches:

1. **Divine Patterns Matter:** You can't just put tiles anywhere; there's a correct arrangement
2. **Preparation Required:** Must accumulate the right tiles before placement
3. **No Partial Credit:** Incomplete rows don't score; must complete the work
4. **Beauty Emerges from Order:** The final wall is beautiful because it follows the pattern

This connects to temple worship and ordinances—specific patterns that must be followed exactly, which create something beautiful and eternal.

#### Deep Dive: The Penalty Mechanic

When you take tiles you can't place, they fall to the floor and **cost points**. This teaches:

- **Overcommitment hurts:** Taking on more than you can handle causes harm
- **Know your capacity:** Must honestly assess what you can accomplish
- **Sometimes less is more:** Strategic restraint prevents negative consequences

This mirrors counsel about not running faster than we have strength ([Mosiah 4:27](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.md)).

#### Potential Modifications for Gospel Game
- **Tiles → Spiritual Experiences:** Must be properly integrated, not just collected
- **Wall Pattern → Life Template:** Following God's plan for your life
- **Floor Line → Worldly Distractions:** Things that pull you from the pattern
- **Factory Displays → Mortal Experiences:** Choose wisely what to take on
- **End Bonuses → Eternal Rewards:** Completion of life's mission brings joy

### Verdict: Excellent Gospel Mechanic Potential ★★★★★
The pattern-following, penalty-for-excess, and completion mechanics naturally teach gospel principles. Players **feel** the importance of preparation, restraint, and finishing.

## MLEM: Space Agency

### Game Overview
- **Designer:** Reiner Knizia (2023)
- **Publisher:** Rebel Studio
- **Players:** 2-5
- **Time:** 45-60 minutes
- **Complexity:** ~2.0/5

### Core Mechanics
1. **Push Your Luck** - Roll dice to advance the rocket
2. **Collective Decision** - Players vote whether to continue or bail
3. **Trust/Risk Assessment** - Deciding when to commit vs. escape
4. **Graduated Rewards** - Further = more points, but more risk
5. **Individual vs. Collective** - Personal escape vs. group success

### How It Plays
Players send cat astronauts on a rocket mission. Each round, dice are rolled to advance. After each roll, players secretly decide: stay on the rocket or eject (bail out). If the rocket crashes, only ejected players score. If it reaches a destination, remaining players score big—but the pilot scores most. Players take turns being pilot.

### Gospel Principle Connections

#### Exceptional Connections

| Mechanic | Gospel Principle | How It Teaches |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Push Your Luck** | Faith vs. Fear | Must commit to the journey despite uncertainty |
| **Collective Decision** | Zion/Unity | Group success requires shared commitment |
| **Trust the Pilot** | Following Prophets/Christ | Someone must lead; others must trust |
| **Graduated Rewards** | Greater Commitment = Greater Blessing | Those who stay longer receive more |
| **Bailing Out Early** | Ye of Little Faith | Safety is guaranteed but limits rewards |
| **Crash Risk** | Trials and Testing | Not every mission succeeds; faith is tested |

#### Deep Dive: The Faith/Commitment Mechanic

MLEM's genius is making players **feel** the tension between safety and faith:

- **Eject now:** Guaranteed small reward, but you abandon the mission
- **Stay on:** Potential for great reward, but risk losing everything
- **The pilot decides:** Must trust someone else's judgment

This perfectly captures the faith dynamic:
- [1 Nephi 3:7](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.md): "I will go and do" requires staying on the rocket
- [Matthew 14:29-31](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/matt/14.md): Peter walking on water—faith until he doubted and sank

#### Deep Dive: The Collective Success Mechanic

When the rocket succeeds, **everyone who stayed benefits**. This teaches:
- Zion is a collective achievement
- Individual defection undermines group success
- Trust in others is required for greatest rewards

But individual choice remains: you can always eject. This respects agency while showing that **isolated safety limits blessings**.

#### Potential Modifications for Gospel Game
- **Rocket → Covenant Path:** Journey of faith with uncertain outcomes
- **Destinations → Celestial Kingdoms:** Greater commitment = higher glory
- **Pilot → Prophet/Leader:** Must trust inspired leadership
- **Ejecting → Leaving the covenant path:** Safe but limiting
- **Dice → Trials:** Random challenges that test commitment
- **Crash → Apostasy/Fall:** What happens when faith fails

### Verdict: Exceptional Gospel Mechanic Potential ★★★★★
The push-your-luck-with-collective-commitment mechanic is perhaps the most directly applicable to teaching faith. Players **experience** the tension of trusting when outcomes are uncertain.

### 🌟 Creative Direction: 2025 Youth Theme Connection

The MLEM mechanic connects powerfully to the **2025 Youth Theme** from [Moses 6:34](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md):

> "Behold my Spirit is upon you, wherefore all thy words will I justify; and the mountains shall flee before you, and the rivers shall turn from their course; and thou shalt abide in me, and I in you; **therefore walk with me.**"

**"Walk with Christ" + Space Journey:**
- The rocket journey = Walking with Christ through mortality
- Staying on despite uncertainty = Faith in the covenant path
- The pilot = Following the Savior's lead
- Destinations = Degrees of glory (stars → moons → sun → **celestial kingdom**)

**Celestial Kingdom Progression Idea:**
Instead of generic destinations, the rocket could travel through:
1. **Telestial stop** (stars) - Small reward, easy bail point
2. **Terrestrial stop** (moon) - Medium reward, moderate risk
3. **Celestial destination** (sun) - Maximum reward for those who endure

This mirrors D&C 76's description of kingdoms and the principle that "he who is not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom cannot abide a celestial glory" ([D&C 88:22](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md)).

## Wingspan (Reference from Previous Research)

### Summary
From [game-ideas.md](game-ideas.md), Wingspan teaches:
- **Ecosystem Interdependence** - Everything connects (Zion community)
- **Unique Contributions** - Each bird has unique abilities (spiritual gifts)
- **Resource Cycling** - Giving creates receiving (law of the harvest)
- **Engine Building** - Investments compound (eternal progression)

### Why It's Excellent for Gospel Games
Wingspan creates **positive-sum gameplay** where building your engine doesn't harm others. This models the gospel economy where "there is enough and to spare" ([D&C 104:17](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/104.md)).

## Pandemic

### Game Overview
- **Designer:** Matt Leacock (2008)
- **Players:** 2-4
- **Time:** ~45 minutes
- **Complexity:** 2.39/5
- **Awards:** 2025 BGG Hall of Fame, 2009 Golden Geek Best Family Game Winner, Spiel des Jahres Nominee

### Core Mechanics
1. **Cooperative Game** - All players win or lose together
2. **Action Points** - Limited actions per turn requiring prioritization
3. **Hand Management/Sharing** - Cards can be passed between players at specific locations
4. **Asymmetric Powers** - Each role has unique abilities
5. **Cascading Events** - Disease outbreaks chain to adjacent cities
6. **Racing Against the Clock** - Must find cures before deck runs out or outbreaks exceed limit

### How It Plays
Players work as a team of specialists fighting four simultaneous disease outbreaks worldwide. Each turn, a player takes 4 actions (travel, treat disease, build research stations, share cards, discover cure), then draws player cards and infects cities. Diseases spread and can "outbreak" to adjacent cities. Team wins by discovering all four cures before time runs out.

### Asymmetric Roles
- **Medic:** Treats all cubes of one color in a city with one action
- **Scientist:** Needs only 4 cards (not 5) to discover a cure
- **Operations Expert:** Can build research stations without discarding
- **Quarantine Specialist:** Prevents disease placement in current/adjacent cities
- **Contingency Planner:** Can recover and reuse event cards

### Gospel Principle Connections

#### Exceptional Connections

| Mechanic | Gospel Principle | How It Teaches |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Cooperative Win/Loss** | Zion or Nothing | "If ye are not one ye are not mine" (D&C 38:27) |
| **Asymmetric Roles** | Spiritual Gifts | Every member has essential contribution |
| **Hand Sharing** | Ministering | Must give what others need, not hoard |
| **Cascading Outbreaks** | Sin/Evil Spreads | Left unchecked, darkness multiplies |
| **Racing the Clock** | Urgency of Gathering | Time is short; work to be done |
| **Research Stations** | Temples/Stakes | Centers of operation that enable work |

### 🌟 Creative Direction: The 144,000 Gathering Game

Your vision connects powerfully to [Revelation 7:4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/rev/7.md) and [D&C 77:11](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/77.md):

**Revelation 7:4:**
> "And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel."

**D&C 77:11** (Joseph Smith's explanation):
> "We are to understand that those who are sealed are **high priests, ordained unto the holy order of God, to administer the everlasting gospel**; for they are they who are ordained out of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, by the angels to whom is given power over the nations of the earth, **to bring as many as will come to the church of the Firstborn.**"

**Game Concept: "Gather Israel"**

Instead of fighting diseases, players are **elite missionaries (possibly translated beings)** seeking out the elect:

- **Disease cubes → Souls in darkness** - People who need the gospel
- **Curing diseases → Gathering the Elect** - Finding those prepared to receive
- **Outbreaks → Satan's influence spreading** - Apostasy, deception, darkness
- **Research stations → Stakes/Temples** - Centers of gathering
- **Player cards → Revelation/Inspiration** - Needed to know where the elect are
- **Finding cures → Establishing Zion cities** - Places of safety in last days

**Asymmetric Missionary Roles:**
- **The Seer:** Can look at upcoming cards (knows where elect will appear)
- **The Healer:** More effective at removing darkness from areas
- **The Builder:** Creates gathering places more efficiently
- **The Gatherer:** Can move elect to safety more quickly
- **The Protector:** Prevents darkness from spreading to adjacent areas

**Win Condition:** Gather the elect to New Jerusalem before the world is overcome

**Note:** This needs serious scriptural research into:
- The role of translated beings in last days gathering
- Doctrine about the 144,000 (who, when, how)
- Prophecies about gathering to New Jerusalem
- What "bringing to the church of the Firstborn" means

### Verdict: Exceptional Gospel Mechanic Potential ★★★★★
Pandemic's cooperative urgency + asymmetric roles + cascading consequences creates a perfect framework for the gathering of Israel.

## The Crew: Quest for Planet Nine

### Game Overview
- **Designer:** Thomas Sing (2019)
- **Players:** 2-5 (3-4 best)
- **Time:** ~20 minutes
- **Complexity:** 1.97/5
- **Awards:** 2020 Kennerspiel des Jahres Winner, Golden Geek Best Cooperative Game

### Core Mechanics
1. **Trick-Taking** - Traditional mechanic (follow suit, highest wins)
2. **Cooperative Goals** - All players must complete mission together
3. **Communication Limits** - Cannot discuss strategy; limited token communication
4. **Mission/Campaign** - 50 missions with increasing difficulty
5. **Task Distribution** - Players claim specific cards they must win

### How It Plays
Players work together to complete trick-taking missions with **severe communication restrictions**. Before play, mission tasks (specific cards that must be won) are distributed among players. You can only communicate by placing ONE token on ONE of your cards once per game, indicating "I have this" or "this is my highest/lowest." Team fails if any task is not completed by the assigned player.

### Gospel Principle Connections

#### Strong Connections

| Mechanic | Gospel Principle | How It Teaches |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Communication Limits** | Veil of Forgetfulness/Prayer | Can't freely discuss; must trust and discern |
| **Cooperative Trick-Taking** | Unity in Diversity | Individual skills contribute to shared goal |
| **Mission Progression** | Line Upon Line | Start simple, build to complex |
| **Task Commitment** | Covenants | Once you claim a task, you must fulfill it |
| **One Token Communication** | Revelation | Limited but crucial divine communication |

#### Deep Dive: The Communication Limit Mechanic

The genius of The Crew is that you **can't just tell people what to do**. This mirrors:

- **The veil:** We can't freely communicate with heaven
- **Prayer/Revelation:** Limited, precious communication we must interpret
- **Trust:** Must believe teammates are doing their best with limited info
- **Discernment:** Reading the situation, making faithful choices

The single communication token is like receiving one piece of revelation—you must choose carefully when and how to use it.

### Potential Gospel Adaptation
- **Missions → Mortal Assignments** - Tasks we covenanted to complete
- **Communication Tokens → Revelation** - Precious, limited divine guidance  
- **Trick-Taking → Navigating Mortality** - Playing our hand well
- **50 Missions → Eternal Progression** - Growing from simple to complex

### Verdict: Strong Gospel Mechanic Potential ★★★★☆
The communication-limited cooperation mechanic uniquely teaches about faith, trust, and the nature of revelation through the veil.

## Forbidden Island

### Game Overview
- **Designer:** Matt Leacock (2010)
- **Players:** 2-4
- **Time:** ~30 minutes
- **Complexity:** 1.74/5
- **Awards:** 2011 Spiel des Jahres Nominee, 2010 Mensa Select Winner

### Core Mechanics
1. **Cooperative Game** - All players win or lose together
2. **Action Points** - 3 actions per turn
3. **Sinking Tiles** - Island locations flood and then sink permanently
4. **Set Collection** - Collect 4 matching cards to claim treasures
5. **Variable Player Powers** - Each role has special abilities
6. **Escape Race** - Must collect treasures and escape before island sinks

### How It Plays
Players explore a sinking island to collect four sacred treasures and escape by helicopter. Each turn: take 3 actions (move, shore up flooded tiles, give cards, capture treasures), draw treasure cards, then draw flood cards (tiles flip to flooded, flooded tiles sink forever). If key locations sink before treasures are claimed, or players can't escape, everyone loses.

### Reimplemented in Series
- Forbidden Desert (2013)
- Forbidden Sky (2018)
- Forbidden Jungle (2025)

### Gospel Principle Connections

#### Strong Connections

| Mechanic | Gospel Principle | How It Teaches |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Sinking World** | Last Days/Mortality | Time is running out; world deteriorating |
| **Shoring Up** | Ministering/Service | Temporarily holding back decay |
| **Collecting Treasures** | Gathering Spiritual Knowledge | Sacred things must be obtained before too late |
| **Escape Together** | Zion/Gathering | Must leave together; no one left behind |
| **Variable Powers** | Spiritual Gifts | Each contributes uniquely to salvation |

#### Deep Dive: The Sinking World Mechanic

The island constantly deteriorates—you can slow it but not stop it. This teaches:

- **Mortality is temporary:** The world is not our permanent home
- **Urgency matters:** Can't delay forever; consequences accelerate
- **Prioritization:** What matters most when time is short?
- **Rescue operation:** Gather what's precious before it's lost

This connects to latter-day prophecy about the earth being "burned" and the righteous being "gathered" ([D&C 29:9](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.md), [D&C 45:26-35](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.md)).

### Potential Gospel Adaptation
- **Island → The World** - Temporary, fading, not our home
- **Treasures → Temple Ordinances/Covenants** - Must obtain before too late
- **Helicopter Escape → Second Coming/Gathering** - Leaving together
- **Flooding → Wickedness/Apostasy** - Encroaching darkness
- **Shoring Up → Temple Work/Missionary Work** - Buying time for salvation

### Verdict: Strong Gospel Mechanic Potential ★★★★☆
The "sinking world + urgent collection + group escape" combination naturally teaches last-days urgency and the importance of gathering.
