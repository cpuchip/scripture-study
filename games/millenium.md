# Millennium: Gather Israel
*Working Title - Cooperative Board Game Concept*

---

## Game Setting

**Theme:** The last days before the Second Coming. Players represent different tribes of Israel with unique roles, working together to gather scattered Israel, build temples, and prepare the earth for Christ's millennial reign.

**Tagline:** *"The gathering of Israel is the most important thing taking place on earth today."* — President Russell M. Nelson

**Doctrinal Foundation:**
> "We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion (the New Jerusalem) will be built upon the American continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and, that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory." — [Articles of Faith 1:10](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.md)

---

## Core Scripture Sources

### The 144,000 High Priests

> "We are to understand that those who are sealed are **high priests, ordained unto the holy order of God, to administer the everlasting gospel**; for they are they who are ordained out of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, by the angels to whom is given power over the nations of the earth, **to bring as many as will come to the church of the Firstborn**."
> — [D&C 77:11](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/77.md)

**Game Mechanic Implication:** Each player represents one of these gathered leaders (12,000 from each tribe). Victory = gathering enough souls into the "Church of the Firstborn."

### The Gathering Keys Restored

> "Moses appeared before us, and committed unto us **the keys of the gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth**, and the leading of the ten tribes from the land of the north."
> — [D&C 110:11](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/110.md)

**Game Mechanic Implication:** Keys unlock special abilities. Moses = gathering from the four corners (board geography). Elias = eternal families/sealing. Elijah = temple ordinances.

### Gathering Pattern (First = Last)

The scattering and gathering of Israel follows a chiastic (reverse) pattern:

| Scattering Order | Group | Gathering Order |
|------------------|-------|-----------------|
| 1st (721 BC) | Ten Tribes to Assyria | Last |
| 2nd (600 BC) | Lehi's family to Americas | 3rd |
| 3rd (586 BC) | Jews (Judah) to Babylon | 2nd |
| 4th (over centuries) | Ephraim among Gentiles | 1st (1830s) |

**Scripture:** [Jacob 5:63](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5.md) - "The last shall be first, and the first shall be last"

**Game Mechanic Implication:** Could create an interesting turn order or scoring mechanic—tribes gathered "first" in the game have different advantages than tribes gathered "last."

## Simplified Role Structure (For Lower Complexity)

Instead of 12 unique roles, consider 4-6 archetypal roles:

|------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Gatherer** | Ephraim + Manasseh | Missionary work, bringing in converts |
| **King** | Judah | Leadership, coordination, authority |
| **Priest** | Levi + Simeon | Temple work, ordinances, teaching |
| **Protector** | Benjamin + Gad | Defense against threats, protection |
| **Messenger** | Naphtali + Zebulun | Movement, communication, transport |
| **Provider** | Asher + Issachar | Resources, service, sustainability |

**Remaining tribes** (Dan, Reuben) could be:
- Special event cards
- Variant game modes
- Expansion content

---

## Core Game Mechanics

### Win Condition
**Gather enough of Israel before the Second Coming.** 

Possible metrics:
- Reach a target number of "gathered souls"
- Build a required number of temples
- Complete specific prophecies
- Survive until the Millennium begins

### Loss Conditions
- Too many souls "lost" (time runs out, opposition wins)
- Key prophecies unfulfilled
- Zion not established

### Action System (Simplified from Pandemic)

**Turn Structure:**
1. **Take Actions** (choose 2-3 from available options)
2. **Draw Cards** (events, resources, blessings)
3. **Face Opposition** (persecution, apostasy, natural disasters)

**Available Actions:**
- **Gather:** Bring scattered Israel into the fold
- **Teach:** Spread gospel knowledge to a region
- **Build:** Construct temples or stakes
- **Travel:** Move to a new region
- **Coordinate:** Give actions/resources to other players
- **Special Ability:** Use tribal power

### Board Geography

**Four Corners of the Earth** (per D&C 110:11):
1. **Americas** (New Jerusalem, promised land of Joseph)
2. **Jerusalem/Middle East** (Old World Zion, Judah's inheritance)
3. **Europe** (scattered Ephraim, early gathering)
4. **"Land of the North"** (ten tribes, mystery regions)

**Key Locations:**
- Temple sites (Salt Lake, Jerusalem, etc.)
- Stakes of Zion
- Mission fields
- Sacred groves

### Opposition Mechanics

**Threats to the Gathering:**
- **Persecution:** Slows gathering, scatters converts
- **Apostasy:** Removes already-gathered souls
- **Deception:** False teachings that confuse
- **War/Conflict:** Blocks regions, requires Gad/Protector

**Escalation:** Like Pandemic's outbreaks, but thematically:
- "The love of many shall wax cold"
- Opposition intensifies as gathering accelerates

---

## Complexity Reduction Strategies

**Target Complexity:** 2.0/5 (lower than Pandemic's 2.39)

### Simplifications from Pandemic:

| Pandemic Element | Millennium Simplification |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| 4 diseases to track | 1 unified "opposition" track |
| Complex cure mechanic | Simple "gather X to complete" |
| Multiple special actions | Streamlined action menu |
| Hand limit management | More forgiving card limits |
| Outbreak chains | Single-level consequences |

### What to Keep:
- Cooperative decision-making
- Asymmetric player powers (tribal roles)
- Escalating tension
- Geographic board
- Variable player count (2-6)

### What to Remove/Simplify:
- Eliminate complex "cure" mechanics
- Remove epidemic card stacking
- Simplify movement rules
- Reduce card types
- Fewer special rules to remember

---

## Thematic Card Ideas

### Blessing Cards
- "Latter-day Revelation" — Draw extra cards
- "Temple Dedication" — Major milestone
- "General Conference" — All players gain benefit
- "Missionary Surge" — Bonus gathering this turn

### Opposition Cards
- "Persecution" — Region becomes hostile
- "Apostasy Wave" — Lose gathered souls
- "Natural Disaster" — Temporarily blocks region
- "War" — Multiple regions affected

### Event Cards
- "Keys Restored" — Unlock new abilities
- "Stick of Judah meets Stick of Joseph" — Unity bonus
- "Ten Tribes Return" — Late-game event
- "Signs in the Heavens" — Timer advances

## Scripture Integration

Every game element should connect to scripture:

| Game Element | Scripture Source |
|--------------|------------------|
| Victory condition | D&C 77:11 (144,000 gathering souls) |
| Board regions | D&C 110:11 (four parts of the earth) |
| Temple building | Isaiah 2:2-3 (mountain of the Lord's house) |
| Opposition | Matthew 24 (signs of the times) |
| Tribal abilities | Genesis 49, Deuteronomy 33 |
| Cooperation | Ezekiel 37:19 (two sticks become one) |

---

## Development Questions

1. **Player Count:** 2-6? Or should it scale differently?
2. **Game Length:** Target 45-60 minutes?
3. **Randomness Level:** How much luck vs. strategy?
4. **Teaching Time:** Under 10 minutes to learn?
5. **Component Simplicity:** Minimize pieces for easier production?
6. **Youth Friendly:** Tie to 2026 theme "I Am the Light of the World"?

---

## Related Youth Theme Connection

**2026 Theme:** "I Am the Light of the World" — [John 8:12](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/john/8.md)

**Connection:** The gathering prepares the way for Christ's coming. Each gathered soul becomes a light. The game's progress could be visualized as light spreading across a darkened world map.

**Visual Mechanic:** As regions are "gathered," they illuminate—creating a visual representation of "the light shineth in darkness" ([John 1:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/john/1.md)).
