# YouTube Video Evaluation Template

A framework for evaluating YouTube content against the gospel standard. Works for gospel-centered content (BYU devotionals, seminary, podcast interviews) *and* secular content (news, commentary, lectures).

Follows the Discovery → Deep Reading → Writing rhythm. Search results are pointers, not sources.

> *"Prove all things; hold fast that which is good."* — [1 Thessalonians 5:21](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/1-thes/5.md)

## Step 2: Discovery

<!-- Use gospel-mcp, gospel-vec, and webster-mcp to find supporting or challenging sources -->
<!-- Note file paths — these are POINTERS to read in Step 3, not sources to quote from -->

### Supporting Scriptures Found
<!-- Scriptures that support the speaker's claims — note file paths for deep reading -->
- 

### Related Conference Talks Found
<!-- Prophetic teachings on the same topics — note file paths for deep reading -->
- 

### Word Study (if applicable)
<!-- Historical word meanings via Webster 1828 that illuminate the discussion -->
-

## Step 3: Deep Reading Checklist

<!-- read_file EVERY source before writing the evaluation -->
<!-- The cite count rule: for N sources cited in the evaluation, perform at least N read_file calls -->

### Sources Referenced by the Video
<!-- For each scripture/talk the speaker cited, read the actual source file -->
- [ ] <!-- Scripture or talk: file path — verified? -->

### Sources Found in Discovery
<!-- For each scripture/talk found via search, read the actual source file -->
- [ ] <!-- Scripture or talk: file path — verified? -->

---

## Step 4: Evaluation

<!-- Write from verified sources only — every quote must come from a read_file, not a search excerpt -->

### In Line
<!-- Messages that align with scripture and prophetic teaching — cite supporting references with links -->


### Out of Line
<!-- Claims that contradict or distort scriptural truth — explain why with references -->
<!-- If nothing is out of line, say so honestly -->


### Missed the Mark
<!-- Messages that are partially true but miss key context — show what's missing -->


### Missed Opportunities
<!-- Great points where a powerful scripture or conference talk would have strengthened the message -->


### Overall Assessment
<!-- Is this content spiritually nourishing? Would you recommend it? To whom? -->
