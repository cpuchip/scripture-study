# AI-Assisted Scripture Study Patterns

This document captures patterns and insights discovered during scripture study sessions to improve future human-AI collaboration.

## The Creation Pattern for Development

*Discovered: January 21, 2026 - Creation Study*

Just as God created all things spiritually before physically, effective AI-assisted development follows a similar pattern:

### Phase 1: Spiritual Creation (Planning/Design)
- **Envision the end goal** - What are we trying to build/understand?
- **Create a blueprint** - Document the plan before implementation
- **Establish principles** - Define constraints and guidelines
- Like creating a `./docs/0_TODO.md` before coding

### Phase 2: Physical Creation (Implementation)
- Work through tasks sequentially
- Each phase builds on the previous
- Review and validate at each stage
- "And God saw that it was good" - checkpoint validation

### Phase 3: Rest and Review (Reflection)
- Document what was learned
- Update patterns for future sessions
- Journal personal insights

## Effective Study Session Structure

1. **Define the topic** - Clear, focused question or theme
2. **Gather context** - Pull relevant scriptures into study file
3. **Cross-reference** - Compare across volumes (OT, NT, BoM, D&C, PoGP)
4. **Analyze patterns** - Look for repetition, differences, emphasis
5. **Apply insights** - Personal relevance and practical application
6. **Document** - Record in journal and update templates

## Key Insights

### On Human-AI Collaboration
- *Planning together* produces better results than ad-hoc requests
- Shared context (files, todos) creates continuity
- Iterative refinement mirrors divine creative process
- "Line upon line, precept upon precept" applies to AI interactions

### On Scripture Study
- Multiple accounts reveal different facets of truth
- Small differences often carry significant meaning
- Context from original languages enriches understanding
- Cross-references illuminate deeper connections
