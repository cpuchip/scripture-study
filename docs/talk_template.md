## Talk Outline

### Opening (1-2 minutes)

Choose ONE primary approach (apostles rarely combine multiple):

**Option A: Engaging Story** ⭐ *Most common in conference talks*
<!-- A brief personal experience or relatable story that introduces your theme naturally. The topic emerges from the story rather than being stated directly. -->

**Option B: Scripture Context**
<!-- Set the scene for a scriptural account that will anchor your message. "In the ninth chapter of John, we read..." -->

**Option C: Thought-Provoking Question**
<!-- A question that invites reflection: "Have you ever wondered why...?" or "What would you do if...?" -->

**Option D: Universal Experience**
<!-- Connect to something everyone has experienced: "Gift giving is a social custom that spans all cultures..." -->

**Opening Image/Theme:**
<!-- What is the central image, metaphor, or theme you'll return to at the end? (Bookending) -->

> **Note:** Avoid extended gratitude for the opportunity to speak—jump into engaging content. If you must acknowledge the assignment, keep it to one brief sentence.

---

### Main Body (7-10 minutes)

Choose a structure that fits your message:

#### Structure Option 1: Thematic Exploration ⭐ *Most flexible*
Explore your theme from multiple angles without rigid points.

**Central Theme:**
<!-- What is the one truth you want people to understand? -->

**Angle 1:**
<!-- Scripture + insight -->

**Angle 2:**
<!-- Different perspective or application -->

**Angle 3:**
<!-- How this applies to daily life -->

**Climactic Story:**
<!-- Your most powerful illustration—place it HERE, near the end of the body, not at the beginning. Include sensory details, build tension, connect directly to your doctrine. -->

---

#### Structure Option 2: Metaphor/Framework Development
Build your message around a central image (roots/branches, gift-giving, weapons, etc.)

**Central Metaphor:**
<!-- What image will carry your message? -->

**How the metaphor illuminates the doctrine:**

**Scripture foundation:**

**Application of the metaphor:**

**Climactic illustration:**

---

#### Structure Option 3: Traditional Points (2-3 points)
If your topic naturally divides into distinct principles.

**Point 1:**
- Principle:
- Scripture:
- Brief illustration:

**Point 2:**
- Principle:
- Scripture:
- Brief illustration:

**Climactic Story** (after points, before conclusion):

---

#### Structure Option 4: Story Collection
Multiple vignettes illustrating your theme (Elder Gong's approach).

**Theme statement:**

**Story 1:** <!-- Brief, illustrative -->

**Story 2:** <!-- Different context, same principle -->

**Story 3:** <!-- Building toward... -->

**Climactic Story:** <!-- Most powerful, most detailed -->

**Doctrinal synthesis:** <!-- What do all these stories teach us? -->

---

### Scripture Integration Guide

Scriptures should be **woven throughout**, not clustered in one section:

| Placement | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Opening | Set context or introduce theme | Scripture story that frames your message |
| Throughout body | Support each insight | "As Alma taught..." / "The Lord declared..." |
| Climactic moment | Doctrinal anchor | Key verse that captures your main point |
| Closing | Final witness | Scripture that reinforces your invitation |

**Target: 10-15 scripture references** (conference talks average 16)

---

### Closing (1-2 minutes)

#### Step 1: Bookend
<!-- Return to your opening image, story, or theme. This creates satisfying closure. -->

#### Step 2: Invitation (choose a format)

**Prayer/Blessing Format** ⭐ *Most common among apostles*
<!-- "May we..." or "It is my prayer that..." or "I pray that we will..." -->

**Question Format**
<!-- "Will you...?" invites personal commitment without commanding -->

**Promise Format**
<!-- "If you will [action], [blessing] will follow" -->

#### Step 3: Testimony
<!-- Weave testimony throughout your talk rather than saving it all for the end. A brief, sincere closing witness is sufficient: "I know..." or "I testify..." -->

#### Step 4: Close
<!-- "In the name of Jesus Christ, amen." -->

<!-- Your most powerful illustration. Include:
- Sensory details (what did you see, hear, feel?)
- Building tension or emotion
- Clear connection to your doctrine
- Place this near the END of your body, not the beginning -->

## Practical Tips

### Timing
- Practice your talk out loud and time it
- Better to finish early than run over
- Leave buffer time for speaking slowly and pausing

### Delivery
- Speak clearly and at a measured pace
- Make eye contact with the congregation
- It's okay to look at your notes
- Pause after important points
- Let the Spirit guide adjustments

### What to Avoid
- Don't apologize for being asked to speak
- Avoid excessive humor or casual language
- Don't criticize Church leaders or policies
- Avoid controversial topics not assigned
- Don't exceed your time limit

### Patterns from the Apostles
Based on [analysis of conference talks](general-conference-examples.md):

| Pattern | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| **Bookending** | Return to your opening image at the close—creates satisfying closure |
| **Climactic story near end** | Doctrine + emotion = transformation |
| **Prayer/blessing close** | "May we..." maintains humility while expressing hope |
| **Questions** | Engage active thinking rather than passive listening |
| **Scripture as structure** | Let a scripture story organize your message |
