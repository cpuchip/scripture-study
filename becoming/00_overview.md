# Becoming

> "Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection." — [D&C 130:18](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.md)

## Purpose

The `/study/` folder is for **discovery**—gathering scriptures, analyzing patterns, understanding doctrine.

The `/becoming/` folder is for **transformation**—applying what we've learned, tracking growth, and practicing discipleship.

**Insight without practice is incomplete.** These documents bridge the gap between knowing and becoming.

## The Tension

There's a real tension in using AI tools for scripture study:

> *"We spent years studying and came to those same conclusions you did in a few minutes..."*

Quick insights can feel like they "cheapen the experience." But here's the distinction:

| Discovery | Becoming |
|-----------|----------|
| Can be accelerated | Requires lived time |
| Intellectual | Experiential |
| Finding the path | Walking the path |
| Minutes or hours | Months or years |
| AI can help | Only you can do |

**The tools shorten discovery, not transformation.**

Knowing that charity means "seeing others as Christ sees them" took minutes with good tools. Actually learning to see others that way took 6 months of prayer—and continues still.

## Structure

Each document in this folder focuses on **practical application**:

1. **The Insight** — What did we discover in study?
2. **The Practice** — How do we live it?
3. **The Journey** — What has the process looked like?
4. **The Fruit** — What changes have come?

## A Pattern for Becoming

From [Moroni 7:48](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.md):

> "Pray unto the Father **with all the energy of heart**, that ye may be **filled with this love**, which he hath **bestowed** upon all who are true followers of his Son"

The pattern:
1. **Desire** — Want it with all your heart
2. **Ask** — Pray consistently and specifically  
3. **Receive** — It is bestowed as a gift
4. **Become** — You are transformed by what you receive

This isn't self-improvement. It's sanctification through grace.
