# Becoming: Charity

> "Charity is the pure love of Christ... pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love" — [Moroni 7:47-48](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.md)

## The Insight

Charity is not primarily about giving money or goods. It is **the pure love of Christ**—having His love dwell in us so we see others as He sees them.

Modern English has obscured this. The 1828 definition listed "love; universal benevolence" first. Today, "charity" primarily means donations to organizations.

The Book of Mormon preserves the original meaning: "charity... is love" ([2 Nephi 26:30](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.md)).

## The Practice

### How I Prayed

My prayer evolved over 6 months:

| Early Prayer | Later Prayer |
|--------------|--------------|
| "Please give me charity" | "Help me see others as Thou seest them" |
| Asking for an attribute | Asking for Christ's vision |
| Abstract | Personal |

The shift in language reflected a shift in understanding. I wasn't asking for a trait—I was asking to borrow His eyes.

### What Changed

When you begin to see others as Christ sees them:

- **Judgment decreases** — You see their struggles, not just their behavior
- **Patience increases** — You understand why they act as they do  
- **Compassion becomes natural** — It flows without effort
- **Defensiveness fades** — Others' actions aren't about you

### Daily Practices

1. **Morning prayer** — Specifically ask to see others with Christ's love today
2. **In the moment** — When frustrated with someone, pause and ask: "How does Christ see this person?"
3. **Evening reflection** — Notice moments when you saw differently

## The Journey

*Personal notes on the process*

### Month 1-2
- Praying felt mechanical: "Give me charity"
- Not sure what I was asking for
- Started studying what charity actually meant

### Month 3-4  
- Prayer language shifted
- "Help me see people as you see them"
- Started noticing small changes in how I responded to difficult people

### Month 5-6
- Realized charity wasn't about effort—it was about receiving
- The gift was being bestowed as I kept asking
- My heart was different, not just my behavior

### Ongoing
- Still a work in progress
- The capacity grows with practice
- Some days are easier than others
- The change is real, even if incomplete

## Questions for Reflection

1. When was the last time I genuinely wondered about someone's story instead of judging their behavior?

2. Who in my life is difficult to love? What might Christ see in them that I'm missing?

3. Am I praying for charity as an attribute to possess, or as Christ's vision to borrow?

4. What evidence do I see that my capacity for love is growing?
