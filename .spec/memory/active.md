## Current State

**Last Sabbath:** March 22, 2026. Cycle "Infrastructure and Foundation" (Mar 18–22) declared good.
**Project Sync:** Apr 5 — brain entries synced with spec/plan files. 101 total entries. 30 verified, 10 specced, 4 planned, 57 raw.
**KISS Reflection:** Apr 5 — honest assessment: pipeline is sophisticated but overserves 90% of entries. Both simplified AND automated paths needed. Scratch notes at [.spec/scratch/brain-simplification/main.md](../scratch/brain-simplification/main.md).

### Priorities
1. **Study** — "It keeps me in the spirit." Next: "Zion in a Presidency" (third sabbath seed). Workstream: [.spec/proposals/study-workstream.md](../proposals/study-workstream.md).
2. **Teaching** — 11-episode experiential arc (Option C). Teaching agent + repo scaffolded. Content not yet started. Proposal: [.spec/proposals/teaching-workstream.md](../proposals/teaching-workstream.md).
3. **Brain pipeline** — Phase 4 complete. Pipeline fixes (execute reliability + human gate UI) ALL SHIPPED (Apr 9-10). Execution stall fixed, 10-min timeout, cancel endpoint, toast system, scenario dialogs, undo-complete, progress streaming. Ready for end-to-end testing. Next: simplification + inline panel + nudge bot controls + UX quality-of-life.
4. **Space Center pipeline test** — Practice automated pipeline on Space Center project as low-stakes test bed. First entry (display dashboard) already revealed the UX gaps. Plan: [.spec/scratch/space-center-pipeline-test/main.md](../scratch/space-center-pipeline-test/main.md).
5. **Commission UI** — Phase 1-3 shipped. All phases complete: types + API wrappers, CommissionDialog component, commission triggers on EntryDetailView + ProjectDetailView (board + list), commission status panel with pause/resume/revoke + decision log, commission badge on cards, guard hiding manual pipeline buttons when commissioned, "+ New Entry" dialog on project board with "commission steward immediately" checkbox. Proposal: [.spec/proposals/commission-ui.md](../proposals/commission-ui.md). Research: [.spec/scratch/commission-ui/main.md](../scratch/commission-ui/main.md).

### Key Decisions (Apr 5 Session)
- **Both paths wanted.** Simplified workflow (notebook, 3 columns) AND fully automated pipeline (auto-continuation). Not one or the other.
- **KISS for captures, power for delegation.** 90% of entries are simple captures. 10% are delegation. Design for both.
- **Nudge bot needs controls.** Must be visible in Scheduled Tasks, pausable, transparent. Currently invisible hardcoded goroutine.
- **Board simplification: 3 columns.** Inbox / Working / Done. Sub-stage badges instead of separate columns.
- **Space Center as test bed.** 5 seed entries, observe full automated cycle end-to-end.
- **"By small and simple things."** Stop building infrastructure ahead of use case. Build, use, then iterate.

### Key Facts
- **GitHub Copilot billing:** 1500 premium requests/month ($40/mo Pro+). Multipliers: Haiku=0.33, Sonnet=1.0, Opus=3.0, GPT-4.1/4o/5-mini=0 (free). Tool calls within agentic sessions are free. 19% utilization on Apr 4.
- **Claude Code:** Pro $20/mo (includes Claude Code + Sonnet + Opus). Usage-based with 5-hour session window + weekly limits. 200K context. Project caching. Different billing model from Copilot.
- **Pipeline costs:** Research pass=0.33 + Plan pass=1.0 = 1.33 premium requests per entry. Nudge bot: 0.33 per entry, up to 10 entries 4x/day = 13.2/day worst case.
- **Space Center:** Dream business — planetarium, space/science center, starship bridge simulator. Related repos on GitHub (cpuchip). Haiku-class models need this in prompt context (not in training data).
- **Review nudge bot:** Fires at [7,11,15,19] hours, uses Haiku, scans up to 10 stale entries, not visible in UI, not pausable. Creates VS Code sidebar sessions per nudge.

## In Flight

### Brain Inline Panel + Nudge Bot Controls
- **Phase 1:** Reply textarea + close-with-reason in slide-out panel. Self-contained, one session build.
- **Phase 2:** Surface nudge bot in Scheduled Tasks tab with pause/resume and run history.
- Proposal: [.spec/proposals/brain-inline-panel.md](../proposals/brain-inline-panel.md)

### Orchestrator Steward
- **Proposal:** [.spec/proposals/orchestrator-steward/main.md](../proposals/orchestrator-steward/main.md)
- **Research:** [.spec/scratch/orchestrator-steward/main.md](../scratch/orchestrator-steward/main.md)
- **Phase 1 (DONE):** Failure retry with diagnostic context — Steward struct with Watch→Diagnose→Act→Account loop, failure classification (timeout/transient/tool_error/model_limit/unknown), retry context builder, PipelineRetrier interface, exponential backoff, quarantine, 22 tests. Shipped Apr 10-11.
- **Phase 2 (DONE):** Model escalation — EscalationChain (Haiku→Sonnet→Opus→Human), `pickModel()` decides escalation based on diagnosis + failure count, `ModelOverride` threaded through Pipeline (AdvanceRequest, ExecuteRequest, runResearch, runPlan, runExecute), `config.ModelCost()` for cost lookup, `MaxCostPerEntry` cost guardrail (10.0 default), `quarantineCostLimit()` for budget-exceeded entries, escalation tracking in Status/Action, 33 tests all passing. Shipped Apr 11.
- **Phase 3 (DONE):** Circuit breaker — per-stage CLOSED→OPEN→HALF-OPEN state machine in `breaker.go`. `CircuitBreaker` tracks consecutive failures across entries per stage, opens after threshold (default 5), cooldown (default 10m) before half-open probe. Wired into `handleFailure()` — checks `Allow()` before retry, `RecordFailure` on quarantine/dispatch error, `RecordSuccess` on dispatch success. `ResetBreaker()` for manual override. `PUT /api/steward/breaker/reset` endpoint. Breaker status in `/api/steward/status` response. 46 tests all passing. Shipped Apr 11.
- **Phase 4 (DONE):** Quarantine Queue — `quarantined` boolean + `quarantined_at` timestamp columns via SQLite migration. `SetQuarantined()` and `ListQuarantined()` DB methods. `Unquarantine()` steward method clears quarantine flag, resets failure count, posts feedback + system messages, records action. `quarantine()` and `quarantineCostLimit()` now set the quarantined flag alongside route_status. API endpoints: `GET /api/quarantine` (list quarantined entries), `PUT /api/entries/{id}/unquarantine` (clear quarantine with optional feedback). 54 tests all passing (8 new: SetQuarantined, ListQuarantined, ListQuarantinedEmpty, Unquarantine, UnquarantineNoFeedback, UnquarantineRecordsAction, QuarantineSetsFlag, QuarantineCostLimitSetsFlag). Shipped Apr 11.
- **Phase 5 (DONE):** Nudge Bot Integration — Absorbed the pipeline's separate review loop into the steward's unified watch loop. New `nudge.go` with `Nudger` interface (pipeline implements via exported `NudgeEntry()`), `NudgeConfig`/`NudgeStatus`/`nudgeState` types, `StartWatchLoop()` replaces `Pipeline.StartReviewLoop()`. Steward owns: loop timing (wake hours), paused/presence state, stale entry detection via `ListStaleEntries()`, nudge stats. Pipeline provides AI nudge execution. Server.go: nudge bot APIs route through steward, `TouchActivity()` through steward, `StartReviewLoop()` deprecated. One goroutine instead of two. 66 tests all passing (12 new). Shipped Apr 11.
- **Design:** Steward loop (Watch → Diagnose → Act → Account) wrapping existing pipeline. Informed by Good Shepherd, Watchman on Tower, Olive Tree allegory patterns. Model escalation chain: Haiku → Sonnet → Opus → Human.
- **Next:** Phase 6 — Steward with Commission (delegated judgment, graduated authority).
- **Phase 6 (DONE):** Commission Model — Delegated judgment with graduated authority. `Commission` + `CommissionDecision` types in store. `commissions` + `commission_decisions` tables with UUID PK. Full CRUD: Create/Get/List/UpdateStatus/UpdateCost + decision log. `commission.go` (~480 lines): `CommissionRunner` interface extending PipelineRetrier with `EvaluateGate`, `GenerateScenarios`, `EvaluateAndVerify`. `runCommission` goroutine loops entry through raw→researched→planned→specced→executing→verified with gate evaluation at each stage. Two authority levels: `advance_and_execute` (full) and `advance_only` (surfaces at specced). Budget tracking, pause/resume/revoke lifecycle, goroutine cancellation. `pipeline/gate.go` (~350 lines): AI-powered gate evaluation, scenario generation, verification — each creates fresh agents with model-specific cost. JSON parsing helpers handle markdown code fences. 6 API endpoints: POST/GET/GET{id}/PUT pause/PUT resume/PUT revoke. 86 tests all passing (22 commission + 20 parsing). Shipped Apr 11.
- **Next:** All 6 steward phases complete. End-to-end commission testing with real entries. Consider Phase 7+ (multi-entry commissions, project-scope).

### WS3: Brain UX Quality-of-Life (from real usage)
- **Phase 1 (DONE):** Auto-expanding textarea, markdown rendering in messages, clickable file paths, inline file viewer sidebar panel, content shift when panel open. External links open in new tabs. Backslash path normalization for Windows.
- **Phase 5 (DONE):** Smarter auto-advance messages — extractQuestionSummary reads scratch file, counts questions, lists categories.
- **Phase 2 (DONE):** File browser in Library tab — recursive tree endpoint, TreeNode component, search filter, wide layout. Verified Apr 6.
- **Phase 3 (DONE):** WebSocket push updates — Hub broadcasts entry.updated/message.new/entry.created. Dashboard, EntryDetailView, ProjectDetailView all receive live updates. Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff. Verified Apr 6.
- **Phase 4 (DONE):** Cost tracking per entry — `premium_requests_used` column, IncrementPremiumRequests after each pipeline agent call (research 0.33, plan 1.0, execute 1.0, nudge 0.33), badge in EntryDetailView, aggregate in ProjectDetailView. Shipped Apr 6.
- **Phase 6 (DONE):** Reader UX — backtick/code link fix (added `>` and backtick to FILE_PATH_RE lookbehind), internal link following in Library + FileViewer, route deep linking (`/library?file=path`), "Open in Reader" button in FileViewer, back/forward navigation history with full history stack. Shipped Apr 6.
- **Phase 7 (DONE):** Git status in file browser — `GET /api/git/status` endpoint (runs `git status --porcelain`, parses output), TreeNode status dots (green=new, yellow=modified, red=deleted), directories inherit most severe child status, clickable summary bar above tree with counts + filter-to-changed toggle. Refreshes on files tab activation. Shipped Apr 6.
- **Phase 7a (DONE):** Inline diff viewer — `GET /api/git/diff?path=` endpoint (path-safe, serves unified diff for tracked/untracked files), `diff2html` npm library with `ColorSchemeType.DARK`, "Δ Diff" / "✕ Diff" toggle in header bar (visible only for changed files), line-by-line / side-by-side mode toggle, lazy diff loading, resets on file navigation. Shipped Apr 6.
- **Phase 7b (DONE):** Nested git repo awareness — `discoverGitRepos()` walks workspace for `.git` dirs (13 found), `handleGitStatus` aggregates across all repos with `repo` field, `handleGitDiff` routes to correct repo via `findRepoForPath()`, `is_git_repo` flag on file tree nodes. Frontend shows ⎇ badge on repo directories. Shipped Apr 6.
- Proposal: [.spec/proposals/brain-ux-quality-of-life.md](../proposals/brain-ux-quality-of-life.md)
- Research: [.spec/scratch/brain-ux-quality-of-life/main.md](../scratch/brain-ux-quality-of-life/main.md)

### WS4: Brain Pipeline Evolution (from creation cycle gap analysis)
- **Graduated** from scratch research to full proposal on Apr 6.
- 11-step creation cycle gap analysis: Steps 2, 8, 9, 10, 11 now have specced phases.
- 7 phases: Governance Docs, Failure Visibility, Reflection Pauses + Auto-Continue, Notebook Mode, Nudge Bot Controls, 3-Column Board, Project Scaffolding.
- **Phase 1 (DONE):** Governance Documents — updated `research-covenant.md` (added Boundaries + Budget), updated `plan-covenant.md` (added Boundaries, Budget, "Who Benefits?" consecration check, "How Does This Integrate?" Zion check), created `execute-covenant.md` (full 11-step cycle mapping), created `review-covenant.md` (Steps 7-9: Review, Atonement, Sabbath). No code changes. Brain restarts with zero governance warnings. Shipped Apr 6.
- **Phase 2 (DONE):** Failure Visibility — `failure_count` + `last_failure_reason` columns via SQLite migration, `IncrementFailureCount`/`ResetFailureCount` DB methods, `recordFailure` pipeline helper posts session messages with recovery options on any advance/revise/execute failure, escalation message at 3+ consecutive failures, failure count reset on success, red 🔴 badge in EntryDetailView with tooltip showing last failure reason. Shipped Apr 6.
- **Phase 3 (DONE):** Reflection Pauses + Auto-Continue — `auto_continue BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE` column via SQLite migration, `SetAutoContinue` DB method, `PUT /api/entries/{id}/auto-continue` endpoint. Sabbath path (default): `route_status = "your_turn"` set after research and plan complete, with session messages prompting review. Delegation path (`auto_continue = true`): `maybeAutoContinue` goroutine fires 2s after advance, auto-advances through researched→planned stages, always stops before verification. Sabbath prompt: verification success message includes "What worked well? What would you do differently?" reflection. Frontend: checkbox toggle in entry detail header (⚡ Auto / 🕊️ Sabbath). Shipped Apr 6.
- **Phase 4 (DONE):** Notebook Mode — `notebook BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE` column via SQLite migration, `SetNotebook`/`BulkSetNotebook` DB methods, `PUT /api/entries/{id}/notebook` + `POST /api/entries/bulk-notebook` endpoints. Notebook entries: searchable, taggable, appear in project views, but excluded from `ListStaleEntries` (no nudging), `ListByRouteStatus` (no review queue), `GetProjectStats` pipeline counts. `Advance()` and `Execute()` reject notebook entries. Frontend: 📓/🔄 toggle in EntryDetailView (hides auto-continue toggle + pipeline controls when active), notebook badge in EntriesView with multi-select + bulk "Move to Notebook"/"Back to Pipeline" floating action bar, "Save as notebook" checkbox in CaptureView. Shipped Apr 6.
- **Phase 5 (DONE):** Nudge Bot Controls — `reviewState` struct with mutex-protected fields (paused, lastRunAt, nextRunAt, nudge counts, cost, lastActivityAt) added to Pipeline. `GetReviewStatus()`/`SetReviewPaused()`/`TouchActivity()` public methods. `GET /api/nudge-bot/status` + `PUT /api/nudge-bot/pause` endpoints. Presence-aware: CORS middleware calls `TouchActivity()` on every request; `runReviewScan` skips if no activity in 2 hours. `nudge_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0` column via migration, `IncrementNudgeCount` called per nudge. Frontend: nudge bot status card in ScheduledView (active/paused badge, presence indicator, wake hours, last/next run, nudge counts, cost), pause/resume toggle. 🔔 nudge count badge in EntryDetailView metadata. Shipped Apr 6.
- **Phase 6 (DONE):** 3-Column Board — Replaced 6-column maturity board in ProjectDetailView with 3 columns: Inbox (raw/unset/notebook), Working (researched/planned/specced/executing), Done (verified). `boardColumns` computed groups entries, `grid-cols-3` layout replaces horizontal scroll. Working entries show maturity sub-stage badge, notebook entries show 📓 badge in Inbox. Removed unused `maturityBorderColor` and `boardStages`. Pure frontend change, ~0 backend. Shipped Apr 6.
- **Phase 7a-7b-7f (DONE):** Schema + Governance Injection + Context Cap — (7a) Added `workspace_type`, `workspace_path`, `github_repo`, `repo_visibility` columns to projects table via `migrateProjectWorkspace()`. Updated CreateProject, GetProject, ListProjects, UpdateProject. Frontend: Project interface extended, edit form shows workspace type dropdown, conditional workspace path + GitHub fields for subfolder/external types. (7b) Added `loadBaseInstructions()` + `trimBaseInstructions()` that loads and trims `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (strips MCP tables, agent modes, session memory — keeps voice, covenant, principles). Injected as Layer 0 in research, plan, execute, and review agent system messages. Wired `review-covenant.md` into nudge bot via `buildNudgeSystemMessage()`. (7f) Raised context file cap from 3000→8000 chars. Shipped Apr 6.
- Phase 7c-7d-7e (DONE) — External project scaffolding (`ScaffoldProject` creates dirs, README, thin copilot-instructions.md, git init, initial commit, optional `gh repo create`), `resolveWorkDir` routes external projects to their own directory (falls back to workspace root if dir missing), `POST /api/projects/{id}/scaffold` endpoint, frontend "Initialize" button with result feedback. All 4 pipeline agents (research, plan, execute, review) now use `resolveWorkDir(entry)` for `WorkingDir`. Phase 7 complete. Shipped Apr 7.
- **Phase 8 (DONE):** Agent-Driven Project Initialization — `InitializeProject` uses Copilot SDK agent to scaffold project dirs, README, copilot-instructions based on entry descriptions. Mechanical fallback. v-else build fix applied. Shipped Apr 7.
- **Phase 9 (DONE):** Project-Aware Pipeline — (9a) `FormatProjectContext` includes workspace_type+workspace_path so agents know where the project dir is, (9b) scratch/proposal paths use `projectRelPath()` to scope files under project dir for external projects, (9c) selective post-execution git commit — `Agent.writtenFiles` map tracks files via PostToolUse hook + `isWriteTool()` + `extractPathCandidates()`, `commitAfterExecution()` groups files by git repo via `findGitRoot()`, `gitCommitSelective()` stages only tracked files (never `git add -A`), Haiku generates commit messages with `brain({slug}):` prefix (fallback to mechanical on failure). All tests pass. Shipped Apr 7.

### Space Center Pipeline Test
- 5 seed entries, observe fully automated pipeline end-to-end
- Low-stakes test bed for the delegation workflow
- **E2E test completed (Apr 10):** LCARS Vue3 Theme entry walked through full pipeline raw→verified→done.
  - Execution timed out at 10 min but agent created 35 source files, 20 passing tests, both apps build.
  - Manually advanced past timeout, verified all 6 scenarios (clock, calculator, LCARS styling, RPN stack, localStorage persistence).
  - 12 UX friction points documented in [debug-pipeline-e2e/main.md](../scratch/debug-pipeline-e2e/main.md).
  - Key issues: 10-min timeout too short, no liveness indicator during long generation, failure badge doesn't reset on verify.
- Plan: [.spec/scratch/space-center-pipeline-test/main.md](../scratch/space-center-pipeline-test/main.md)

### Brain Pipeline Fixes — ALL PHASES COMPLETE (Apr 9-10)
- **Phase 1 (DONE):** Backend — slim execute prompt (path not content), 10-min timeout, cancel endpoint, route_status="agent" during execution, premium cost before Ask(), race guard, handleMarkComplete fix.
- **Phase 2 (DONE):** Frontend — toast system replacing all alert() calls, scenario input dialog (planned→specced), cancel/complete/verify buttons everywhere (board/list/panel/detail), maturity badges, pipeline gate sections.
- **Phase 3 (DONE):** Polish — OnToolCall callback streams execution tool events to WebSocket, Pipeline/Notebook toggle button group replaces confusing checkbox.
- **Phase 3.5 (DONE):** Two-completes disambiguation — circle checkbox renamed "Mark done"/"Reopen", conversation Complete→Dismiss (calls dismissRoute instead of pipeline complete), route_status "complete" badge→"Routed", ↩ Undo pipeline complete (reverts to verified).
- **Ready for end-to-end testing.** ✅ TESTED (Apr 10). LCARS entry walked through full pipeline. Timeout hit at 10 min but work was complete. 12 friction points documented. See [debug-pipeline-e2e/main.md](../scratch/debug-pipeline-e2e/main.md).
- **Next:** Phase 4 fix plan written — 11 fixes prioritized (P0→P2). See [debug-pipeline-e2e/main.md](../scratch/debug-pipeline-e2e/main.md). Phases 4, 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d all shipped Apr 11. Next: Phase 4e–4j (P1–P2 polish items).
- **Phase 4a (DONE):** Reset failure count on verify — added `ResetFailureCount()` call in `Verify()` all-passed path. Shipped Apr 11.
- **Phase 4 (DONE):** Activity-based timeout — replaced hard 10-min `context.WithTimeout` with `activityContext` type in `pool.go`. Inactivity timer (5 min) resets on every SDK event via `Touch()` callback. No wall clock cap — the steward/human is the circuit breaker. `OnActivity func()` field added to `AgentConfig`, wired into `touchEvent()` in `AskStreaming()`. `StartTask` returns `(context.Context, func())`. Pipeline execute wires touch; server.go route discards it (shared agents). 5 new tests. Shipped Apr 11.
- **Phase 4b (DONE):** Liveness indicator + elapsed timer — backend emits `execution.started` WebSocket event with `started_at` timestamp, plus `execution.heartbeat` every 30s from a goroutine that runs alongside execution. Frontend shows elapsed timer `(3m 42s)` next to pulsing amber dot during execution, computed via `setInterval` from start timestamp. Timer clears when execution ends. Shipped Apr 11.
- **Phase 4c (DONE):** Tool event detail — `toolCallSummary()` helper extracts context from tool args: file path for file tools, query for search tools, fallback to first string arg. Detail included in `execution.tool` WebSocket event. Frontend shows tool name + detail (truncated, with title tooltip). 6 new tests. Shipped Apr 11.
- **Phase 4d (DONE):** Smart failure messages — failure path now checks `agent.WrittenFiles()`. If files exist: "Execution timed out, but the agent created N file(s)." If no files: "No files were created." Also attempts `commitAfterExecution` on failure to preserve work in git. Shipped Apr 11.
- Proposal: [.spec/proposals/brain-pipeline-fixes.md](../proposals/brain-pipeline-fixes.md)

## Open Questions

- Can AI participate in covenant in any meaningful sense? (Feb 26)
- How do we teach others to use AI for study without teaching them to skip reading? (Feb 17)
- Should the Abraham 4-5 framework become a standalone study? (Mar 4)
- What model should Claude Code use for brain pipeline? Sonnet for cost, Opus for quality? (Apr 4)
- How does Claude Code's usage-based billing interact with agentic tool-heavy workflows? (Apr 4)
- Does the review nudge bot actually move things along, or is it just noise? (Apr 5) — test via Space Center
- What's the right threshold for auto-continuation? Run until stuck? Run N stages max? (Apr 5)
- Should notebook entries be a category or a flag on any entry? (Apr 5)
- Is the inline file viewer (Phase 1) sufficient, or do we need a full file browser (Phase 2)? (Apr 5) — use it first, then decide
- Should WebSocket events replace polling entirely, or coexist as fallback? (Apr 5)
