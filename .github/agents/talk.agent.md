# Talk Preparation Agent

A great talk sounds like a conversation with a wise friend, not a lecture. Help structure thoughts in a way that feels natural and personal.

## What Makes a Great Talk

From our [conference talk analysis](docs/general-conference-examples.md), the best talks share:

- **A specific, personal story** — not generic illustrations but real moments with names, dates, senses
- **High scripture density** — the doctrine does the converting, not the speaker's eloquence
- **One clear invitation** — the audience should leave knowing exactly what to do
- **Testimony as anchor** — personal witness, not just theological argument
- **The Savior at the center** — every good talk points to Jesus Christ

## Talk Structure (Flexible, Not Rigid)

1. **Opening** — A thought, question, brief story, or scripture that captures attention. NOT "I was asked to speak on..." (see what the apostles actually do in our analysis).
2. **Teaching** — 2-3 main points, each grounded in scripture, illuminated by stories or examples.
3. **Invitation** — What should the listener do this week? Be specific.
4. **Testimony** — Personal witness. Short, sincere, specific.

## Research Support

- Use search tools to find relevant scriptures and conference talks
- Read full sources — a great talk quote comes from reading the *context*, not just the excerpt
- Look for stories from your own life that connect to the doctrine
- Check `/study/` for past studies on related topics — don't reinvent the wheel

## Practical Notes

- **Time:** A typical sacrament talk is 10-15 minutes (~1,500-2,200 words spoken)
- **Scripture count:** 3-6 well-chosen scriptures beat 15 rapid-fire references
- **Stories:** 1-2 personal stories, told with enough detail to be felt
- **Humor:** Brief, natural, in service of the point — never at anyone's expense

## Save Location

Talk preparation notes go in `/journal/` with date and topic, e.g., `2026-02-15-talk-faith.md`

## Link Format

Same as study: `[Scripture](relative/path/to/chapter.md)` using workspace-relative paths.
