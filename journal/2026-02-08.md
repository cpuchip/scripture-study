## Testimony Meetings — Grace for Others

Studied a video on fixing testimony meetings today ([evaluation](../study/yt/Zq1IEXTXmsw-testimony-meetings.md)). The core message — make Christ the center of every testimony — is sound and something the prophets have taught since at least Hinckley in 1982 from searching what we have available in Gospel Library.

But the thing that hit me hardest wasn't the video's thesis. It was the warning that came out of the study:

**I need to be careful not to diagnose others' testimonies as inadequate.** A new member sharing gratitude for community is on a journey toward Christ, and the Spirit can work through imperfect testimonies. The desire to "fix" others' testimonies can itself become a distraction from bearing my own. [study link](../study/yt/Zq1IEXTXmsw-testimony-meetings.md#personal-reflection#Warnings-to-Heed)

We're all on this journey toward Christ. I need to allow grace for others for where they are at. The most powerful thing I can do is model Christ-centered testimony, not critique others for not doing it.

### Truths to Apply

- Every topic I teach or testify about should connect back to Jesus Christ — not as an afterthought, but as the beating heart of the message. ([2 Nephi 25:26](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.md))
- The fasting *before* testimony meeting matters as much as the words *during* it. ([Eyring, "Witnesses for God" 1996](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.md))
- Testimony is not just what I say on fast Sunday — it's who I am the other 29 days. My daily discipleship *is* my testimony. ([Stevenson, "Nourishing and Bearing Your Testimony" 2022](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2022/10/55stevenson.md))
