## Testimony Meetings — Grace for Others

Studied a video on fixing testimony meetings today ([evaluation](../study/yt/Zq1IEXTXmsw-testimony-meetings.md)). The core message — make Christ the center of every testimony — is sound and something the prophets have taught since at least Hinckley in 1982 from searching what we have available in Gospel Library.

But the thing that hit me hardest wasn't the video's thesis. It was the warning that came out of the study:

**I need to be careful not to diagnose others' testimonies as inadequate.** A new member sharing gratitude for community is on a journey toward Christ, and the Spirit can work through imperfect testimonies. The desire to "fix" others' testimonies can itself become a distraction from bearing my own. [study link](../study/yt/Zq1IEXTXmsw-testimony-meetings.md#personal-reflection#Warnings-to-Heed)

We're all on this journey toward Christ. I need to allow grace for others for where they are at. The most powerful thing I can do is model Christ-centered testimony, not critique others for not doing it.

### Truths to Apply

- Every topic I teach or testify about should connect back to Jesus Christ — not as an afterthought, but as the beating heart of the message. ([2 Nephi 25:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25?lang=eng&id=p26#p26))
- The fasting *before* testimony meeting matters as much as the words *during* it. ([Eyring, "Witnesses for God" 1996](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god?lang=eng))
- Testimony is not just what I say on fast Sunday — it's who I am the other 29 days. My daily discipleship *is* my testimony. ([Stevenson, "Nourishing and Bearing Your Testimony" 2022](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/10/55stevenson?lang=eng))

## Morgan Philpot — From Fear to Faith

Finished the full evaluation project on Morgan Philpot's "Signs of the Times" presentation today. Nine phase evaluations, a 10-pass transcript review, 33 verbal-only items evaluated, four reformed Marp slide decks. Months of work.

Two years ago I watched one of his presentation and got swept up in the urgency. The dates, the predictions, the "be prepared by 2029" — it consumed me. Fear of the coming of the Lord overtook me. That's not how it's supposed to work.

I've come to terms with that now. I don't know when the Lord is coming. No one does ([D&C 49:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49?lang=eng&id=p7#p7)). But I think the season is at hand. The turmoil in the world, the rise of AI tools, wickedness proclaimed from digital rooftops, the fighting getting worse with nothing changing — I do worry a split will happen around the 2028 elections. It's no accident that we study the Book of Mormon in Come Follow Me every four years alongside election seasons. The parallels that Philpot and Elder Bednar point out are striking.

But here's the shift: **when my fear dropped and my faith increased, hope started to spring up about the Second Coming.** Not dread — hope. Because I realized it's about pointing myself toward Christ always. Having a broken heart and a contrite spirit. Being humble before the Lord. Knowing that whatever happens, me and my family will be alright — whether that's in this life or the next. It doesn't matter.

Oh, I want to be as prepared as I can be. But using 3 Nephi as a template — the *first* coming — and likening it to us at His second: if it happens in my lifetime, there is no amount of physical preparation alone that could save me. The people at Bountiful survived destruction that leveled cities. They survived because the Lord preserved them, not because they had bunkers. A mix of physical and spiritual is the only way, and praying for miracles to sustain us in whatever comes.

That's why I'm building this study repo. That's why the AI scripture study buddy matters. Not to predict dates — to build the kind of relationship with the scriptures and with Christ that sustains you through anything.

### What Philpot Gets Right (That I Want to Keep)

- The harvest framework — Leviticus 23 feasts mapped to dispensational phases
- Hebrew/Greek word studies — mō·w·'ă·ḏîm, Zarahemla/hemlah, storm vs. tempest
- JST Revelation 12 as Restoration blueprint
- The invitation to liken scriptures aggressively, not passively
- The observation that Come Follow Me cycles align with election years

### What I'm Leaving Behind

- Specific dates (2029, 2033, "be prepared to go")
- Political figure mappings (Lachoneus = Trump, Gidgiddoni = Musk)
- Conspiracy-adjacent claims (Federal Reserve, shadow government, SEC extortion)
- Fear-based urgency ("I invite you to be crazy with me")

### What I Want to Build

A revised study series — [morgan-philpot-revised](../study/morgan-philpot-revised/) — that takes the best of Philpot's scriptural insights, combines them with our deep-read scripture work, and adds new connections. A lawyer's perspective on the scriptures, grounded in the text, with the Spirit as the guide instead of fear as the engine.

> *"If ye are prepared ye shall not fear."* — [D&C 38:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38?lang=eng&id=p30#p30)

The preparation that matters most is spiritual. Physical preparation supports it. But the broken heart and contrite spirit — that's the foundation everything else rests on.
