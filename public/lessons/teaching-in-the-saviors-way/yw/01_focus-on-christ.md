**Principle:** Focus on Jesus Christ  
**Duration:** 10 minutes

---

## Core Message

> "No matter what you are teaching, remember that you are really teaching about Jesus Christ and how to become like Him."  
> — [Teach about Jesus Christ No Matter What You Are Teaching](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teaching-in-the-saviors-way-2022/04-part-1/05-teach-about-jesus-christ?lang=eng)

**The two dimensions:**
1. **Teach ABOUT Christ** — Connect your topic to His example, His roles, His teachings
2. **Help them COME UNTO Christ** — Help your class *feel* His love and want to be like Him

The second one is where real conversion happens.

## 10-Minute Outline

### 1. The Core Principle (3 min)

**Say something like:**

"When you teach on 2nd and 4th Sundays, you're not just covering a topic—you're helping your friends come closer to Jesus Christ. 

Every topic can point to Him. Service? He served. Honesty? He is truth. Prayer? He taught us how. Your job isn't just to share *information* about Jesus—it's to help your classmates *experience* Him."

### 2. Simple Lesson Planning (4 min)

**Hand out the [handout](01_focus-on-christ-handout_01.md) and walk through it:**

"Here's a simple way to plan any lesson. For each principle you want to teach, think about:
- What scriptures support it?
- What questions will help them discover it?
- What teaching aids might help?
- What invitation will you give, and what blessings can you promise?

You might have 2 or 3 of these in a lesson. Keep it simple."

### 3. Invitation & Testimony (3 min)

**Ask:**
> "The next time you teach, what's ONE thing you could do to help your class experience Christ—not just hear about Him?"

Let 1-2 share if time permits.

**Bear brief testimony** and close with this promise:

> "As you help your learners come to know Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ for themselves, they will be more likely to turn to Them for help, hope, and healing throughout their lives."
