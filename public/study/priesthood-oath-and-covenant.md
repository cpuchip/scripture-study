# The Oath and Covenant of the Priesthood

A comprehensive study of the priesthood oath and covenant, the responsibilities of an Elder in the Melchizedek Priesthood, and God's promises to faithful priesthood holders.

---

## Core Text: D&C 84:33-44

This is the foundational passage on the oath and covenant:

> **33.** For whoso is **faithful** unto the **obtaining these two priesthoods** of which I have spoken, and the **magnifying their calling**, are **sanctified** by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies.
>
> **34.** They become the **sons of Moses** and of Aaron and the **seed of Abraham**, and the church and kingdom, and the **elect of God**.
>
> **35.** And also all they who receive this priesthood **receive me**, saith the Lord;
>
> **36.** For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me;
>
> **37.** And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father;
>
> **38.** And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore **all that my Father hath shall be given unto him**.
>
> **39.** And this is according to the **oath and covenant** which belongeth to the priesthood.
>
> **40.** Therefore, all those who receive the priesthood, receive this oath and covenant of my Father, **which he cannot break**, neither can it be moved.
>
> **41.** But whoso **breaketh this covenant** after he hath received it, and altogether turneth therefrom, shall **not have forgiveness** of sins in this world nor in the world to come.

— [D&C 84:33-41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p33-p41#p33)

## What IS the Oath and Covenant?

### The Two Parts

1. **Our Covenant** (What we promise):
   - Be **faithful** unto obtaining both priesthoods (Aaronic and Melchizedek)
   - **Magnify** our calling

2. **God's Oath** (What He promises):
   - We are **sanctified** by the Spirit
   - We become **elect of God**, heirs with Abraham
   - We receive **all that the Father hath** (exaltation)

### Key Insight: An Oath vs. A Covenant

- A **covenant** is a mutual agreement - both parties make promises
- An **oath** is a unilateral promise, solemnly binding
- God adds His **oath** to His covenant promises - meaning He *cannot* fail to keep His word

> "Therefore, all those who receive the priesthood, receive this oath and covenant of my Father, **which he cannot break**, neither can it be moved." — [D&C 84:40](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p40#p40)

This is extraordinary: God binds Himself by oath. If we keep our part, He is oath-bound to bless us with *everything* He has.

---

## Key Terms from Webster's 1828 Dictionary

Understanding these terms as Joseph Smith would have understood them illuminates the meaning of D&C 84.

### OATH
> "A solemn affirmation or declaration, made with a **reverent appeal to God** for the truth of what is affirmed."

An oath is not merely a promise—it is a promise with God as witness and guarantor. When God Himself makes an oath, He stakes His divine honor on fulfillment.

### COVENANT
> "A **mutual agreement** of two or more persons or parties... The **promises of God** as revealed in the Scriptures, **conditioned on certain terms** on the part of man, as obedience, repentance, faith, etc."

A covenant is binding when both parties fulfill their terms. God's part is guaranteed by His oath.

### OBTAIN
> "To **get hold of by effort**; to gain possession of; to procure; to acquire, in any way."

Key insight: To *obtain* implies **desire** and **effort directed toward attainment**. Obtaining is different from merely receiving.

### RECEIVE
> "To **take, as something that is offered**, given, committed, sent, paid, or the like; to accept."

To *receive* means accepting what is offered. Combined with "obtain," we see the full picture: we must actively seek (obtain) and then humbly accept (receive) both priesthoods.

### MAGNIFY
> "To **increase the importance of**; to cause to be held in greater esteem or respect; to make greater... To **praise highly**; to extol."

To magnify a calling is to increase its influence, make it matter more, and bring glory to God through it.

## What Does "Obtaining These Two Priesthoods" Mean?

This question sparked deeper study: Does "obtaining" mean being ordained? Or does it include receiving the saving ordinances connected to the priesthood?

### The Question

D&C 84:33 says: "For whoso is faithful unto the **obtaining these two priesthoods**..."

Is this fulfilled when a man is:
1. **Ordained** to the Aaronic and then Melchizedek priesthood? Or...
2. When he **receives the ordinances** (baptism, gift of Holy Ghost, endowment, sealing) that flow from priesthood power?

### What Modern Prophets Teach

**Elder Carlos E. Asay (1985)** identified four elements of man's covenant:
1. Receive the Melchizedek Priesthood **in good faith**
2. **Magnify** callings given
3. **Obey** all the commandments
4. **Live by every word** of God

— [The Oath and Covenant of the Priesthood](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1985/10/the-oath-and-covenant-of-the-priesthood?lang=eng)

He noted: "The transcendent blessings of the priesthood **do not come by ordination alone**. We are instructed: 'Ordination to the priesthood is a **prerequisite** to receiving [blessings], but it does not **guarantee** them.'"

**President Russell M. Nelson (2011)** taught that blessings "flow from this oath and covenant to **worthy men, women, and children** in all the world."

— [Covenants](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2011/10/covenants?lang=eng)

This suggests the covenant's blessings extend beyond those ordained.

**Elder Quentin L. Cook (2019)** stated directly:
> "When a man and woman are sealed in the temple, they enter **the holy order of matrimony in the new and everlasting covenant, an order of the priesthood**. Together they **obtain and receive priesthood blessings and power** to direct the affairs of their family."

— [Great Love for Our Father's Children](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2019/04/43cook?lang=eng)

**Sister Julie B. Beck (2006)** quoted President Ezra Taft Benson:
> "When our children obey the Lord and go to the temple to receive their blessings and enter into the marriage covenant, they enter into **the same order of the priesthood** that God instituted in the very beginning with father Adam."

She added: "We teach all young men and young women to prepare to go to the temple so they can **'receive the blessings of [the] fathers that [they] may be entitled to the highest blessings of the priesthood.'**"

— [An Outpouring of Blessings](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2006/04/an-outpouring-of-blessings?lang=eng)

### A Broader Understanding

Based on these teachings, "obtaining these two priesthoods" appears to encompass:

1. **For men**: Ordination to the Aaronic priesthood, then Melchizedek priesthood
2. **For all**: Receiving the ordinances administered by those priesthoods:
   - Baptism (Aaronic)
   - Gift of the Holy Ghost (Melchizedek)
   - Temple endowment (Melchizedek)
   - Sealing/Eternal marriage (Melchizedek)

The "highest blessings of the priesthood" come through temple covenants—available to both men and women who worthily receive them.

### The Pattern of Faithful Obtaining

From Webster's definition: obtaining requires **effort directed toward attainment**. This is not passive. The pattern is:

1. **Desire** the blessings
2. **Prepare** worthily
3. **Receive** with faith
4. **Magnify** through service
5. **Endure** faithfully to the end

## What Does It Mean to "Magnify" a Calling?

The word "magnify" appears throughout scripture in connection with priesthood service:

> "For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the **magnifying their calling**, are sanctified by the Spirit" — [D&C 84:33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p33#p33)

### Related Passages

> "And again, verily I say unto you, the duty of a president over the office of a high priest is to preside over the whole church, and to be like unto Moses — Behold, here is wisdom; yea, to be a seer, a revelator, a translator, and a prophet, having all the gifts of God which he bestows upon the head of the church." — [D&C 107:91-92](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng&id=p91-p92#p91)

> "**Magnify thine office**; and after thou hast sowed thy fields and secured them, go speedily unto the church which is in Colesville" — [D&C 24:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/24?lang=eng&id=p9#p9)

To magnify means:
- To make **larger** — expand the influence of your calling
- To make **clearer** — help others see God through your service
- To take it **seriously** — not treat it lightly
- To **grow** in it — become more effective over time

## Duties and Responsibilities of an Elder

### Direct Instructions from D&C 20:42-46

> **42.** And to **teach, expound, exhort, baptize**, and watch over the church;
>
> **43.** And to **confirm** the church by the laying on of the hands, and the giving of the Holy Ghost;
>
> **44.** And to take the lead of all meetings... when there is **no high priest** present;
>
> **45-46.** The elder or priest functions in the **absence of high priests**...

— [D&C 20:42-46](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20?lang=eng&id=p42-p46#p42)

### The Elder's Place in the Priesthood

> "The office of an **elder comes under the priesthood of Melchizedek**." — [D&C 107:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng&id=p7#p7)

> "The Melchizedek Priesthood holds the **right of presidency**, and has **power and authority over all the offices** in the church in all ages of the world, to administer in spiritual things." — [D&C 107:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng&id=p8#p8)

### Practical Duties

An Elder is authorized to:
- **Teach** the gospel and scriptures
- **Expound** doctrine (explain in depth)
- **Exhort** (encourage, warn, motivate)
- **Baptize** converts
- **Confirm** members and bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost
- **Ordain** other elders, priests, teachers, and deacons
- **Administer** the sacrament
- **Bless the sick** through laying on of hands
- **Give priesthood blessings** of comfort and counsel
- **Watch over** and minister to members

## What the Priesthood Holds: Keys and Power

### The Greater Priesthood's Purpose

> **19.** And this greater priesthood **administereth the gospel** and holdeth the **key of the mysteries of the kingdom**, even the **key of the knowledge of God**.
>
> **20.** Therefore, in the **ordinances** thereof, the **power of godliness** is manifest.
>
> **21.** And without the ordinances thereof, and the **authority of the priesthood**, the power of godliness is **not manifest** unto men in the flesh;
>
> **22.** For **without this no man can see the face of God**, even the Father, and live.

— [D&C 84:19-22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p19-p22#p19)

### Key Insight: Ordinances as Access Points

The priesthood doesn't just *authorize* ordinances—it makes the **power of godliness** present in them. Baptism, confirmation, the sacrament, temple ordinances—these become channels for divine power because of priesthood authority.

---

## God's Promises to Faithful Priesthood Holders

### The Ultimate Promise: Exaltation

> "And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore **all that my Father hath shall be given unto him**." — [D&C 84:38](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p38#p38)

This is not metaphor. "All that my Father hath" includes:
- Eternal life
- Exaltation
- Eternal increase (posterity)
- Kingdoms, thrones, dominions
- Godhood

### The Path to the Promise

The receiving chain in [D&C 84:35-38](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p35-p38#p35):

1. Receive the **priesthood** → receive the Lord's servants
2. Receive the **servants** → receive the Lord
3. Receive the **Lord** → receive the Father
4. Receive the **Father** → receive His kingdom

### Abraham's Covenant Connection

> "They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and **the seed of Abraham**" — [D&C 84:34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p34#p34)

This ties directly to God's covenant with Abraham:

> "And I will bless them through thy name; for as many as receive this Gospel shall be called after thy name, and shall be accounted **thy seed**, and shall rise up and bless thee, as their father... **this right shall continue in thee, and in thy seed after thee**" — [Abraham 2:10-11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/2?lang=eng&id=p10-p11#p10)

---

## Melchizedek: The Model of Priesthood

The priesthood is named after Melchizedek because of his greatness:

> "Why the first is called the Melchizedek Priesthood is because **Melchizedek was such a great high priest**. Before his day it was called *the Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God*. But out of respect or reverence to the name of the Supreme Being, to avoid the too frequent repetition of his name, they, the church, in ancient days, called that priesthood after Melchizedek" — [D&C 107:2-4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng&id=p2-p4#p2)

### What Made Melchizedek Great?

Alma provides the best portrait:

> "Now this Melchizedek was **a king over the land of Salem**; and his people had waxed strong in **iniquity and abomination**; yea, they had all gone astray; they were full of all manner of wickedness;
>
> "But Melchizedek having exercised **mighty faith**, and received the office of the high priesthood according to the holy order of God, **did preach repentance unto his people**. And behold, **they did repent**; and Melchizedek **did establish peace** in the land in his days; therefore he was called **the prince of peace**, for he was the king of Salem" — [Alma 13:17-18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/13?lang=eng&id=p17-p18#p17)

### Lessons from Melchizedek:
1. He started with a **wicked people** — the situation was bad
2. He exercised **mighty faith** — not nominal faith
3. He **preached repentance** — he taught, didn't just administer
4. His people **actually repented** — his ministry bore fruit
5. He **established peace** — lasting transformation

**This is magnifying a calling.**

---

## Priesthood Line of Authority

The priesthood comes through an unbroken chain:

> **14.** Which **Abraham received the priesthood from Melchizedek**, who received it through the lineage of his fathers, even till **Noah**;
>
> **15.** And from Noah till **Enoch**, through the lineage of their fathers;
>
> **16.** And from Enoch to **Abel**... who received the priesthood by the commandments of God, by the hand of his father **Adam**, who was the first man—
>
> **17.** Which priesthood continueth in the church of God in all generations, and is **without beginning of days or end of years**.

— [D&C 84:14-17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p14-p17#p14)

## How to Use Priesthood Power Righteously

### The Warning: D&C 121:34-40

> **34.** Behold, there are **many called, but few are chosen**. And why are they not chosen?
>
> **35.** Because their hearts are set so much upon the **things of this world**, and aspire to the **honors of men**, that they do not learn this one lesson—
>
> **36.** That the **rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven**, and that the powers of heaven **cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness**.
>
> **37.** That they may be conferred upon us, it is true; but when we undertake to **cover our sins**, or to gratify our **pride**, our **vain ambition**, or to exercise **control or dominion or compulsion** upon the souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the **heavens withdraw themselves**; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn, **Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man**.

— [D&C 121:34-37](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121?lang=eng&id=p34-p37#p34)

### The Pattern: D&C 121:41-46

> **41.** No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by **persuasion**, by **long-suffering**, by **gentleness** and **meekness**, and by **love unfeigned**;
>
> **42.** By **kindness**, and **pure knowledge**, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile—
>
> **43.** **Reproving betimes with sharpness**, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an **increase of love** toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy;
>
> **44.** That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of death.
>
> **45.** Let thy bowels also be full of **charity towards all men**, and to the household of faith, and let **virtue garnish thy thoughts** unceasingly; then shall thy **confidence wax strong** in the presence of God; and the **doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven**.
>
> **46.** The **Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion**, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy **dominion shall be an everlasting dominion**, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee **forever and ever**.

— [D&C 121:41-46](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121?lang=eng&id=p41-p46#p41)

### The Virtues of Righteous Priesthood Holders

| Virtue | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Persuasion** | Inviting, not commanding |
| **Long-suffering** | Patient with others' weaknesses |
| **Gentleness** | Soft in approach, not harsh |
| **Meekness** | Power under control, teachable |
| **Love unfeigned** | Genuine, not pretended affection |
| **Kindness** | Active goodwill toward others |
| **Pure knowledge** | Truth without ulterior motives |
| **Charity** | The pure love of Christ |
| **Virtue** | Moral excellence in thought |

## The Consequences of Breaking the Covenant

This is a solemn warning:

> "But whoso **breaketh this covenant** after he hath received it, and **altogether turneth therefrom**, shall **not have forgiveness** of sins in this world nor in the world to come." — [D&C 84:41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p41#p41)

### What Does "Altogether Turneth Therefrom" Mean?

This isn't about:
- Making mistakes
- Struggling with weaknesses
- Temporary failures

This is about:
- **Completely** rejecting the priesthood
- **Knowingly** turning against God
- Becoming a **son of perdition** (see [D&C 76:31-34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng&id=p31-p34#p31))

The context suggests this applies to those who, having received the fullness of the priesthood and a testimony like unto the Apostles, then deny the Holy Ghost and shed innocent blood.

For the rest of us, the covenant includes constant **repentance** and renewal.

## Priesthood Authority in Action: Examples

### Healing and Miracles

> "And the elders of the church, two or more, shall be called, and shall pray for and lay their hands upon them in my name; and if they die they shall die unto me, and if they live they shall live unto me." — [D&C 42:44](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42?lang=eng&id=p44#p44)

> "And **whoso shall ask it in my name in faith, they shall cast out devils**; they shall **heal the sick**; they shall cause the **blind to receive their sight**, and the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak, and the lame to walk." — [D&C 35:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/35?lang=eng&id=p9#p9)

### Sealing Power

> "And it shall come to pass, that **whatsoever ye shall seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven**; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven" — [Helaman 10:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/10?lang=eng&id=p7#p7)

### The Signs That Follow Believers

> "And these **signs shall follow them that believe**: In my name they shall do many wonderful works; In my name they shall cast out devils; In my name they shall **heal the sick**; In my name they shall **open the eyes of the blind**, and unstop the ears of the deaf" — [D&C 84:65-66](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p65-p66#p65)
