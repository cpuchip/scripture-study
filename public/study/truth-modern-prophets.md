# Modern Prophets on Truth, Light, and the Atonement

*Study started: February 11, 2026*
*Prerequisite: [The Mechanics of Existence: Truth, Light, Spirit, Matter, and Law](./truth.md)*

> "There is a power, a strong influence, that emanates from the Savior. It proceeds 'forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space.' Because this power enlightens, uplifts, and illuminates our lives, the scriptures often call it light, but it is also referred to as spirit and truth."
> — [President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, "Bearers of Heavenly Light," October 2017](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2017/10/bearers-of-heavenly-light?lang=eng)

## Purpose

The [Mechanics of Existence](./truth.md) mapped the scriptural framework — truth, light, intelligence, spirit, element, and law — drawing exclusively from the standard works. The [Atonement study](./truth-atonement.md) connected Christ as the operating principle of that framework, also from scripture alone.

This companion study asks: **What have modern prophets and apostles taught about these same doctrines?** Not to replace the scriptural foundation, but to show how living oracles have expanded, applied, and witnessed these truths across the last century of general conference.

The pattern holds: scripture provides the doctrine; prophets provide the witness and the application.

## Part 1: Light, Truth, and Intelligence — "All Kinds of Light Are Related"

The [truth study](./truth.md) established the D&C 93 equivalence chain: truth = light = spirit = intelligence. It showed that these are *not* metaphors but descriptions of a single unified reality operating at different scales. What have modern prophets said about this?

### Elder Theodore M. Burton — "Light and Truth" (April 1981)

Elder Burton, a scientist by training, approached D&C 88:6-13 with the eyes of both a physicist and a disciple. His conclusion was striking:

> "God's light includes the physical light we see... God's light is also the power to understand and comprehend all things. In other words, **all kinds of light are related to intelligence and truth.**"
> — [Elder Burton, "Light and Truth," April 1981](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1981/04/light-and-truth?lang=eng)

This is exactly the equivalence chain from [truth.md Part 2](./truth.md) — light is not a metaphor for understanding; it IS understanding, AND physical illumination, AND the governing law, simultaneously. Burton made it explicit: "all kinds of light are related."

He then quoted the verse that collapses the spiritual-temporal divide entirely:

> "All things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal."
> — [D&C 29:34-35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29?lang=eng&id=p34-p35#p34)

Burton's reaction: "As I begin to understand this scripture, my whole concept of physical existence and these physical bodies is changing." He saw what the truth study mapped — that the matter spectrum from spirit to element is not a metaphor. It's real. Physical light and spiritual light are the *same* light operating at different scales.

He used the metaphor of absolute zero — the theoretical temperature at which all molecular motion ceases — to describe spiritual darkness:

> "Satan and those who follow him are on the road to losing whatever degree of light and truth they have and are approaching a similar limit of darkness and cold where all joy and happiness cease."

This parallels the [truth study's asymmetry principle](./truth.md): light has infinite gradation upward; darkness is the absence, the zero-point. There is no "dark energy" — only the withdrawal of light.

**Burton's summary sentence is gold:** "Light and truth is, simply, pure intelligence." That is D&C 93 compressed to eight words.

### President Dieter F. Uchtdorf — "Bearers of Heavenly Light" (October 2017)

Where Burton approached from the physical sciences, President Uchtdorf approached from lived spiritual experience. He quoted D&C 84:45 directly:

> "The word of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light, and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ."
> — [D&C 84:45](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p45#p45)

And then testified:

> "This profound insight — that light is spirit, which is truth, and that this light shines upon every soul who comes into the world — is as important as it is hopeful."
> — [President Uchtdorf, "Bearers of Heavenly Light," October 2017](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2017/10/bearers-of-heavenly-light?lang=eng)

He also provided one of the most instructive analogies for the darkness-as-absence principle:

> "Night is nothing more than a shadow... the sun does not cease to radiate its light."

And further:

> "Darkness is not an indication that there is no light. Most often, it simply means we're not in the right place to receive the light."

This perfectly illustrates what the [truth study's Part 5](./truth.md) calls the "asymmetry of light and darkness." Darkness has no independent substance. It is positional — we have turned away, or something blocks the light. The light itself never stops radiating.

Uchtdorf then quoted D&C 88:67 — the same "body filled with light" passage that forms the climax of the [Atonement study](./truth-atonement.md):

> "If your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things."
> — [D&C 88:67](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p67#p67)

His comment: "This is the ultimate remedy for spiritual sickness. Darkness vanishes in the presence of light." The prophetic witness corroborates the scriptural mechanics — the cure for darkness is not to fight darkness, but to receive light.

### Elder Neal A. Maxwell — "Premortality, a Glorious Reality" (October 1985)

Elder Maxwell grounded the doctrine of intelligence in its revelatory history, tracing how D&C 93 expanded what the Book of Mormon and Book of Moses had begun. He quoted the pivotal verses directly:

> "Man was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be. ... For man is spirit. The elements are eternal, and spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy."
> — [D&C 93:29, 33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng&id=p29#p29)

And from Abraham:

> "If there be two spirits, ... notwithstanding one is more intelligent than the other, [they] have no beginning; they existed before, they shall have no end ... for they are ... eternal."
> — [Abraham 3:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=p18#p18)

Maxwell noted that the doctrine of premortality — including the uncreated nature of intelligence — "could only come from restoration by modern revelation. It was certainly not abroad in the land of America until Joseph Smith's articulations." He also captured the practical consequence: "This doctrine brings unarguable identity but also severe accountability to our lives."

The [truth study](./truth.md) demonstrated that intelligence cannot be created or destroyed. Maxwell testified to the *personal* implications: if we are eternal, we are also eternally accountable. "Premortality is not a relaxing doctrine."

## Part 2: Christ IS the Power — It Is the Savior, Not "The Atonement"

The [Atonement study](./truth-atonement.md) emphasized that Christ is not an addendum to the system but its operating principle. President Nelson delivered a landmark correction on how we speak about this.

### President Russell M. Nelson — "Drawing the Power of Jesus Christ into Our Lives" (April 2017)

> "There is no amorphous entity called 'the Atonement' upon which we may call for succor, healing, forgiveness, or power. Jesus Christ is the source. Sacred terms such as *Atonement* and *Resurrection* describe what the Savior did... but Jesus Christ did it."
> — [President Nelson, "Drawing the Power of Jesus Christ into Our Lives," April 2017](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives?lang=eng)

And more sharply:

> "It is doctrinally incomplete to speak of the Lord's atoning sacrifice by shortcut phrases such as 'the Atonement' or 'the enabling power of the Atonement'... These expressions present a real risk of misdirecting faith by treating the event as if it had living existence and capabilities independent of our Heavenly Father and His Son."

This is a prophetic correction with deep doctrinal precision. The [Atonement study](./truth-atonement.md) asks "How does a fallen being traverse the spectrum upward?" The answer is not a mechanism — it is a *Person*. Christ *is* the light of truth (D&C 88:6-7). He *is* the law by which all things are governed (D&C 88:13). He didn't merely create a program called "the Atonement" — He *descended below all things* and *comprehended all things* so that He could be *in all and through all things* (D&C 88:6).

Nelson quoted Joseph Smith to anchor the doctrine:

> "The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day."

And then provided the practical key:

> "When you spiritually stretch beyond anything you have ever done before, then His power will flow into you."

The mechanics of grace are *relational*, not transactional. You don't draw from an abstract reservoir — you draw from a Person by reaching toward Him.

### Elder Boyd K. Packer — "Atonement, Agency, Accountability" (April 1988)

Elder Packer provided the etymological foundation that the [Atonement study's Part 3](./truth-atonement.md) builds on:

> "Atonement is really three words: **At-one-ment**, meaning to set at one, one with God; to reconcile, to conciliate, to expiate."
> — [Elder Packer, "Atonement, Agency, Accountability," April 1988](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1988/04/atonement-agency-accountability?lang=eng)

He also noted a remarkable textual fact: the word "atonement" appears only *once* in the entire English New Testament (Romans 5:11) — but ***fifty-five times*** in the Book of Mormon. Packer's conclusion: "What better witness that the Book of Mormon is indeed another testament of Jesus Christ?"

Critically, Packer linked agency and atonement as inseparable:

> "Had agency come to man without the Atonement, it would have been a fatal gift."

This is the [Atonement study's "law cannot lift you"](./truth-atonement.md) principle stated with devastating economy. Law, agency, and the capacity to fall are all necessary for moral growth — but without a Redeemer, they become a death sentence. The law tells you you're fallen. Agency ensures it was your choice. And without the Atonement, there is no mechanism for reversal.

> "All wickedness could not quench that light. When what was done was done, the ransom had been paid. Both death and hell forsook their claim on all who would repent. Men at last were free."

And the key:

> "Repentance is the escape clause in it all. Repentance is the key with which we can unlock the prison from inside."

### Elder Earl C. Tingey — "The Great Plan of Happiness" (April 2006)

Elder Tingey reinforced the at-one-ment etymology with a family lens:

> "The word *atonement,* or 'at-one-ment,' means to restore or to come back. In terms of family, it means to be reunited with one another and with God and His Son, Jesus Christ. It means sadness through separation will become happiness through reuniting."
> — [Elder Tingey, "The Great Plan of Happiness," April 2006](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2006/04/the-great-plan-of-happiness?lang=eng)

His teaching connects the Atonement to the [truth study's circle of existence](./truth.md) — the whole arc from intelligence through mortality to glory is a story of separation and reunion. We came from God's presence, we descended, and the Atonement provides the path of return.

---

## Part 3: The Enabling Power — Grace as Strength, Not Just Forgiveness

The [Atonement study](./truth-atonement.md) asks not just "How are sins forgiven?" but "How is nature *changed*?" This is the distinction between the *redeeming* and *enabling* dimensions of grace. Modern prophets have expanded on this with exceptional clarity.

### Elder David A. Bednar — "In the Strength of the Lord" (October 2004)

Elder Bednar drew directly from the Bible Dictionary definition of grace:

> "The main idea of the word is **divine means of help or strength**, given through the bounteous mercy and love of Jesus Christ."
> — [Bible Dictionary, "Grace"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bd/grace?lang=eng)

And the key enabling clause:

> "It is likewise through the grace of the Lord that individuals, through faith in the atonement of Jesus Christ and repentance of their sins, receive **strength and assistance to do good works that they otherwise would not be able to maintain if left to their own means.** This grace is an enabling power that allows men and women to lay hold on eternal life and exaltation after they have expended their own best efforts."
> — [Elder Bednar, "In the Strength of the Lord," October 2004](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2004/10/in-the-strength-of-the-lord?lang=eng)

He then stated the transformative implication:

> "The enabling and strengthening aspect of the Atonement helps us to see and to do and to become good in ways that we could never recognize or accomplish with our limited mortal capacity."

Notice the three verbs: *see, do, become.* Grace doesn't just forgive what we've done wrong — it opens our eyes to truths we couldn't otherwise perceive, gives us strength for works we couldn't otherwise perform, and transforms us into something we couldn't otherwise become. This is the *traversal of the matter spectrum* from the [truth study](./truth.md) — the movement from coarse to refined, from the natural man to the saint — made possible by the enabling power of Christ's sacrifice.

Bednar quoted Ammon to capture the experience:

> "In his strength I can do all things."
> — [Alma 26:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/26?lang=eng&id=p12#p12)

### Tad R. Callister — "The Atonement of Jesus Christ" (April 2019)

Elder Callister systematized the Atonement's scope into four obstacles it overcomes:

1. **Physical death** — overcome through resurrection
2. **Sin and spiritual death** — overcome through repentance and forgiveness
3. **Afflictions and infirmities** — Christ descended below them all
4. **Weaknesses and imperfections** — overcome through enabling power (grace)

The fourth category is crucial. Most doctrinal discussions focus on the first two. But Callister emphasized the fourth as the *crowning* work of the Atonement:

> "Because of His Atonement, the Savior has enabling powers, sometimes referred to as grace, that can help us overcome our weaknesses and imperfections and thus assist us in our pursuit to become more like Him."
> — [Elder Callister, "The Atonement of Jesus Christ," April 2019](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2019/04/45callister?lang=eng)

He then quoted George Q. Cannon:

> "No man ought to say, 'Oh, I cannot help this; it is my nature.' He is not justified in it, for the reason that God has promised to give gifts that will eradicate [our weaknesses]."

This directly counters the despair that the [Atonement study](./truth-atonement.md) addresses — the feeling that the law condemns without providing a way forward. The enabling power is the way forward. It's not merely pardon for past failure; it's actual *power to change one's nature*.

Callister used a parachute analogy to explain the relationship between law and grace:

> The law of gravity (justice) operates constantly. The parachute (the Atonement) doesn't negate gravity — it works *within* the law to slow the descent and bring you safely to earth.

And he cited D&C 84:20 for the channel through which enabling power flows:

> "In the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest."
> — [D&C 84:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p20#p20)

His concluding statement ties it back to the [truth study's circle of existence](./truth.md):

> "The Savior's Atonement is not only infinite in scope but also individual in reach — that it can not only return us to God's presence but also **enable us to become like Him** — the crowning goal of Christ's Atonement."

And Truman G. Madsen, quoted by Callister:

> "I bear testimony that you cannot sink farther than the light and sweeping intelligence of Jesus Christ can reach... He did not just descend to your condition; he descended below it."

## Part 4: Born Again — The Process of Ascending the Spectrum

The [Atonement study](./truth-atonement.md) describes the conditions of sanctification: faith, repentance, ordinances, the Holy Ghost. Modern prophets have taught that being "born again" is not a single dramatic event but an ongoing *process* — a gradual refinement of soul that corresponds to ascending the matter spectrum from coarse to pure.

### Elder D. Todd Christofferson — "Born Again" (April 2008)

> "Spiritual rebirth originates with faith in Jesus Christ, by whose grace we are changed. More specifically, it is **faith in Christ as the Atoning One, the Redeemer, who can cleanse from sin and make holy.**"
> — [Elder Christofferson, "Born Again," April 2008](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2008/04/born-again?lang=eng)

> "Both our own action and the intervention of divine power are needed for this transformative rebirth — for the change from natural man to saint."

His extended treatment of [Moses 6:59-60](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p59-p60#p59) is essential:

> "The baptism of repentance by water leads to the baptism of the Spirit. The Spirit brings the atoning grace of Christ, symbolized by His blood, both to **justify** (or pardon) our sins and to **sanctify** (or cleanse) us from the effects of sin, making us spotless and holy before God."

This maps directly to the [Atonement study's treatment of Moses 6:59-60](./truth-atonement.md) — the water/Spirit/blood sequence as the mechanism of refinement. Justification addresses what we've *done*; sanctification addresses what we *are*. Both come through the Atonement of Christ.

And critically:

> "Being born again, unlike our physical birth, is **more a process than an event.** And engaging in that process is the central purpose of mortality."

> "As you continue in the path of spiritual rebirth, **the atoning grace of Jesus Christ will take away your sins and the stain of those sins in you**, temptations will lose their appeal, and through Christ you will become holy, as He and our Father are holy."

### Elder David A. Bednar — "Ye Must Be Born Again" (April 2007)

Elder Bednar's famous pickle parable provides the most vivid prophetic illustration of the sanctification process:

A cucumber is transformed into a pickle through three steps:
1. **Preparing and cleaning** — Aaronic Priesthood, repentance, baptism
2. **Immersing and saturating in brine** — living in the gospel, covenants (salt = covenants)
3. **Purifying and sealing** — Melchizedek Priesthood, Holy Spirit of Promise

> "The essence of the gospel of Jesus Christ entails a **fundamental and permanent change in our very nature** made possible through our reliance upon 'the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah.'"
> — [Elder Bednar, "Ye Must Be Born Again," April 2007](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2007/04/ye-must-be-born-again?lang=eng)

> "The spiritual rebirth described in this verse typically does not occur quickly or all at once; it is an ongoing process — not a single event. Line upon line and precept upon precept, gradually and almost imperceptibly, our motives, our thoughts, our words, and our deeds become aligned with the will of God."

And a warning against superficial engagement:

> "Sporadic and shallow dipping in the doctrine of Christ and partial participation in His restored Church cannot produce the spiritual transformation... Rather, **fidelity to covenants, constancy of commitment, and offering our whole soul unto God** are required."

Bednar cited D&C 76:50-53 — those who are "washed and cleansed" and "sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise" — and concluded:

> "Purifying and sealing by the Holy Spirit of Promise constitute the culminating steps in the process of being born again."

### Elder David A. Bednar — "Always Retain a Remission of Your Sins" (April 2016)

This talk extended the born-again doctrine into a powerful framework of *ongoing* cleansing through ordinances:

> "Being born again, comes by the Spirit of God through ordinances."
> — [Joseph Smith, quoted by Elder Bednar](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2016/04/always-retain-a-remission-of-your-sins?lang=eng)

Bednar identified three ordinances that form an interrelated pattern of redemptive progress:

1. **Baptism by immersion** — the *initial cleansing* from sin
2. **Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost** — the *ongoing cleansing* from sin by the sanctifying power of the Spirit
3. **The sacrament** — the *repeated invitation* to renew covenants and retain that cleansing

> "The ordinances of baptism by immersion, the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, and the sacrament are not isolated and discrete events; rather, they are **elements in an interrelated and additive pattern of redemptive progress.** Each successive ordinance elevates and enlarges our spiritual purpose, desire, and performance."

His central insight: the sacrament does not itself remit sins. But as we prepare conscientiously and participate with a broken heart and contrite spirit, the *promise* is renewed — "that we may *always* have the Spirit of the Lord to be with us." And it is by the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost as a constant companion that we "always retain a remission of our sins."

This is the mechanism the [Atonement study](./truth-atonement.md) describes as the grace-for-grace cycle operationalized through covenants. The ordinances are not bureaucratic checkboxes — they are "authorized channels through which the blessings and powers of heaven can flow into our individual lives."

He quoted D&C 84:19-21:

> "This greater priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of God. Therefore, **in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest.** And without the ordinances thereof, and the authority of the priesthood, the power of godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh."
> — [D&C 84:19-21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p19-p21#p19)

---

## Part 5: Becoming, Not Doing — The Final Judgment as Character

The [truth study's Part 7](./truth.md) identified the destination: "What is glory? **It is the intelligence that clings to you.**" The [Atonement study](./truth-atonement.md) framed it as the body filled with light. Modern prophets have taught this as the doctrine of *becoming*.

### Elder Dallin H. Oaks — "The Challenge to Become" (October 2000)

This talk is arguably the single most important modern prophetic statement on the *becoming* doctrine:

> "The Final Judgment is not just an evaluation of a sum total of good and evil acts — what we have *done*. It is an **acknowledgment of the final effect of our acts and thoughts — what we have *become.***"
> — [Elder Oaks, "The Challenge to Become," October 2000](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2000/10/the-challenge-to-become?lang=eng)

> "The commandments, ordinances, and covenants of the gospel are not a list of deposits required to be made in some heavenly account. The gospel of Jesus Christ is a plan that shows us **how to become** what our Heavenly Father desires us to become."

He used the parable of a wealthy father and his son:

> "That which I have I can easily give you, but **that which I *am* you must obtain for yourself.**"

God cannot simply *bestow* celestial character. It must be *grown*, through the very process the Atonement provides — faith, repentance, covenants, ordinances, trials, and the Holy Ghost.

Oaks clarified that charity itself illustrates the *being* vs. *doing* distinction:

> "Charity is not an act but a condition or state of being. **Charity is attained through a succession of acts that result in a conversion.** Charity is something one *becomes.*"

And this, on the role of suffering:

> "Our needed conversions are often achieved more readily by suffering and adversity than by comfort and tranquillity... the refinement and sanctification possible through such experiences can help us achieve what God desires us to become."

### Elder Quentin L. Cook — "Conversion to the Will of God" (April 2022)

Cook stated the transformation doctrine concisely:

> "Conversion to the Savior changes a natural man into a **sanctified, born again, purified person** — a new creature in Christ Jesus."
> — [Elder Cook, "Conversion to the Will of God," April 2022](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/04/29cook?lang=eng)

> "True conversion is the result of the conscious acceptance of the will of God and ... we can be guided in our actions by the Holy Ghost."

And: "True conversion is brought about by the conscious acceptance and commitment to follow the will of God." The emphasis on *will* is important — it echoes the [truth study's](./truth.md) principle that truth acts "for itself" (D&C 93:30) and that agency is the mechanism by which beings ascend or descend the spectrum.

---

## Part 6: Love, Law, and Kingdoms — The Architecture of Glory

The [truth study](./truth.md) established that "all kingdoms have a law given" (D&C 88:36) and that the glory you receive corresponds to the law you abide. The [Atonement study](./truth-atonement.md) showed that the degrees of glory are not arbitrary rewards but *descriptions of how much light a being can hold*. Modern prophets have taught this with precision.

### Elder Dallin H. Oaks — "Love and Law" (October 2009)

Oaks addressed a common misconception — that God's love should override His law — and corrected it:

> "The love of God does not supersede His laws and His commandments, and the effect of God's laws and commandments does not diminish the purpose and effect of His love."
> — [Elder Oaks, "Love and Law," October 2009](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2009/10/love-and-law?lang=eng)

> "God's love is so perfect that He lovingly requires us to obey His commandments because He knows that **only through obedience to His laws can we become perfect, as He is.** For this reason, God's anger and His wrath are not a *contradiction* of His love but an *evidence* of His love."

He quoted D&C 130:20-21 and then linked it to D&C 88:22-24,35-36:

> "That which breaketh a law, and abideth not by law, but seeketh to become a law unto itself, and willeth to abide in sin, and altogether abideth in sin, **cannot be sanctified by law, neither by mercy, justice, nor judgment.** Therefore, they must remain filthy still."
> — [D&C 88:35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p35#p35)

> "In other words, the kingdom of glory to which the Final Judgment assigns us is not determined by love but by the law that God has invoked in His plan to qualify us for eternal life."

This is the [truth study's](./truth.md) principle of law as the governing structure of all kingdoms, stated with judicial precision. The law doesn't punish arbitrarily — it describes what a being can *abide*. A telestial being cannot survive celestial glory any more than a candle can survive the surface of the sun. The law is protective, not punitive.

### President Dallin H. Oaks — "Kingdoms of Glory" (October 2023)

By 2023, now as First Counselor in the First Presidency, President Oaks gave an extended treatment of D&C 76 and D&C 88:

> "All kingdoms have a law given" and "the kingdom of glory we receive in the Final Judgment is determined by the laws we choose to follow in our mortal journey."
> — [President Oaks, "Kingdoms of Glory," October 2023](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/10/17oaks?lang=eng)

He described the three kingdoms with doctrinal exactness:

- **Celestial:** "received of his fulness, and of his glory... they are gods, even the sons [and daughters] of God"
- **Terrestrial:** "honorable men of the earth, who were blinded by the craftiness of men" but "not valiant in the testimony of Jesus"
- **Telestial:** "he who cannot abide a terrestrial glory"

And quoted President Nelson:

> "During this mortal life you get to choose which laws you are willing to obey — those of the celestial kingdom, or the terrestrial, or the telestial — and, therefore, in which kingdom of glory you will live forever."

Then Oaks returned to his signature theme: "The gospel of Jesus Christ challenges us to *become* something... The commandments, ordinances, and covenants of the gospel are *not* a list of deposits required to be made in some heavenly account."

The kingdoms are not arbitrary tiers of reward. They are descriptions of *what you have become* — how much light you can hold, how much law you can abide, how much glory your soul can sustain. This is the [truth study's](./truth.md) matter spectrum applied to eternal outcomes.

### President Marion G. Romney — "Easter Thoughts" (April 1975)

President Romney connected the resurrection directly to the D&C 88 and 93 framework:

> "The spirit and the body are the soul of man."
> — [D&C 88:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p15#p15), quoted by [President Romney, "Easter Thoughts," April 1975](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1975/04/easter-thoughts?lang=eng)

> "Spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy; And when separated, man cannot receive a fulness of joy."
> — [D&C 93:33-34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng&id=p33-p34#p33)

Romney then explained the connection between law, resurrection, and kingdoms:

> "Men will be judged in the spirit world and rewarded according to their works. In the resurrection, **their bodies will be quickened by the glory of the kingdom, the laws which they have obeyed** during this temporal, mortal life."

This is D&C 88:17-32 in application: the glory that quickens your resurrected body is the glory of the law you lived. The truth study's matter spectrum and the Atonement study's refinement process converge here — your eternal body will be *composed of* the light you chose to receive.

Romney also clarified the distinction between immortality and eternal life:

> "*Immortality* denotes length of life — deathless. *Eternal life* denotes quality of life — the quality of life God enjoys."

Everyone receives immortality through the Resurrection. But eternal life — the *fulness* of joy, the celestial quality — requires the sanctification process the Atonement makes possible.

## Part 7: The Refiner's Fire — Trials as Purification

The [Atonement study's Part 5](./truth-atonement.md) describes Christ as "Advocate, Mediator, Refiner." The refining metaphor runs through modern prophetic teaching as well. Trials are not random cruelty; they are the furnace in which coarse matter is purified.

### Elder James E. Faust — "The Refiner's Fire" (April 1979)

Elder Faust opened with the account of the Martin Handcart Company — survivors who lost everything but gained the most precious thing:

> "The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay, and I am thankful that I was privileged to come in the Martin Handcart Company."
> — Quoted by [Elder Faust, "The Refiner's Fire," April 1979](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1979/04/the-refiners-fire?lang=eng)

Faust's interpretation:

> "In the pain, the agony, and the heroic endeavors of life, we pass through a refiner's fire, and **the insignificant and the unimportant in our lives can melt away like dross** and make our faith bright, intact, and strong. In this way **the divine image can be mirrored from the soul.** It is part of the purging toll exacted of some to become acquainted with God."

This is the matter spectrum in action. The dross — the impurities, the attachments to coarse things — melts away under the heat of affliction, leaving the pure intelligence, the light of truth, the divine image. The refiner's fire doesn't *add* something new; it *reveals* what was always there beneath the dross.

Faust connected this to the doctrine of being born again:

> "In our extremities, it is possible to become born again, born anew, renewed in heart and spirit. We no longer ride with the flow of the crowd, but instead we enjoy the promise of Isaiah to be renewed in our strength and 'mount up with wings as eagles.'"

And quoting the Author of this process:

> "Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him."
> — [Hebrews 5:8-9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/5?lang=eng&id=p8-p9#p8)

Even Christ — the purest Being — "learned obedience" through suffering. The refiner's fire is not a punishment for impurity alone; it is the universal process by which intelligence is perfected.

### Elder D. Todd Christofferson — "The Divine Gift of Repentance" (October 2011)

Christofferson beautifully connected repentance to the enabling-power doctrine:

> "Without repentance, there is no real progress or improvement in life. Pretending there is no sin does not lessen its burden and pain. Suffering for sin does not by itself change anything for the better. **Only repentance leads to the sunlit uplands of a better life.** And, of course, only through repentance do we gain access to the atoning grace of Jesus Christ and salvation."
> — [Elder Christofferson, "The Divine Gift of Repentance," October 2011](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2011/10/the-divine-gift-of-repentance?lang=eng)

He quoted D&C 88:40 to illustrate how repentance aligns with the light-attracts-light principle from the [truth study](./truth.md):

> "Virtue loveth virtue; light cleaveth unto light; mercy hath compassion on mercy and claimeth her own."
> — [D&C 88:40](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p40#p40)

His comment: "Divine forgiveness and healing flow quite naturally to such a soul." The law of attraction in the spiritual realm — light cleaving to light, mercy claiming her own — is not magic. It's the mechanics of existence responding to a being who has chosen to align with the light. Repentance is the act of turning from the absence of light toward its source. The light does the rest.

And the conclusion, quoting the Savior:

> "For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent; But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I."
> — [D&C 19:16-17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19?lang=eng&id=p16-p17#p16)

## Part 8: Summary — The Prophetic Witness

The modern prophets don't replace the scriptural framework of [truth.md](./truth.md) and [truth-atonement.md](./truth-atonement.md). They confirm it, expand it, and ground it in personal application.

| Truth Study Theme | Prophetic Witness |
|---|---|
| **Light = Spirit = Truth = Intelligence** (D&C 93) | Burton: "All kinds of light are related to intelligence and truth." Uchtdorf: "Light is spirit, which is truth." |
| **Darkness is absence, not substance** | Uchtdorf: "Night is nothing more than a shadow... the sun does not cease to radiate its light." Burton: Absolute zero as spiritual metaphor. |
| **Christ IS the light of truth** (D&C 88:6-7) | Nelson: "There is no amorphous entity called 'the Atonement'... Jesus Christ is the source." |
| **The matter spectrum: pure → coarse** | Romney: Bodies "quickened by the glory of the kingdom, the laws which they have obeyed." |
| **Law governs all kingdoms** (D&C 88:36) | Oaks: "The kingdom of glory we receive is determined by the laws we choose to follow." |
| **Grace as enabling power** | Bednar: Grace is "strength and assistance to do good works that they otherwise would not be able to maintain." |
| **The Atonement changes nature, not just status** | Oaks: "The Final Judgment is... what we have *become*." Callister: "Enable us to become like Him — the crowning goal." |
| **Born again is a process** | Christofferson: "More a process than an event." Bednar: Pickle parable — preparation, saturation, sealing. |
| **Trials as refinement** | Faust: "The insignificant and unimportant melt away like dross... the divine image can be mirrored from the soul." |
| **Spirit and element inseparably connected** (D&C 93:33) | Maxwell: Intelligence "was not created or made, neither indeed can be... they are eternal." Romney: "Spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy." |
| **The circle of existence** | Tingey: Atonement means "to restore or to come back... reunited with one another and with God." |
| **Ordinances as channels of power** | Bednar: "In the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest." Ordinances are "authorized channels through which blessings and powers of heaven flow." |

## Become

What remains after absorbing the prophetic witness is not new doctrine — it is *confirmed* doctrine, with the added weight of personal testimony from those called to witness.

The mechanics are real. The spectrum from coarse to pure is not a metaphor. Light, truth, spirit, and intelligence are one reality. Christ is not an addendum to the system but the very power that makes the system work. The Atonement — *His* act, *His* sacrifice, *His* descent below and comprehension of all things — is the mechanism by which fallen beings ascend the spectrum, receive more light, and eventually become what God already is.

The prophets add something the scriptures alone cannot: the testimony that this process *works*. That people who go through the refiner's fire come out with "the absolute knowledge that God lives." That the enabling power of Christ's grace is real and has changed actual human lives. That the process of being born again, however gradual and imperceptible, is "the central purpose of mortality."

**What will I do?**

1. When I feel the weight of my fallen nature, I will remember Nelson: Christ is the source. Not an abstract mechanism, but a Person.
2. When I feel overwhelmed by what I need to *become*, I will remember Bednar: grace is "strength and assistance to do good works that they otherwise would not be able to maintain."
3. When trials come, I will remember Faust: the refiner's fire melts away dross and reveals the divine image beneath.
4. When I am tempted to treat covenants as checkboxes, I will remember Oaks: "The commandments are not a list of deposits. The gospel is a plan that shows us how to *become.*"
5. When I partake of the sacrament, I will remember Bednar's framework: initial cleansing (baptism), ongoing cleansing (the Holy Ghost), and the repeated invitation to retain a remission of sins through the bread and water.

> "If your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things."
> — [D&C 88:67](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p67#p67)
