### Phase Evaluations

| # | Document | Title | Verbal Coverage |
|---|----------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | [01_foundation.md](01_foundation.md) | Foundation & the Harvest Framework | **Good** — Core 4-harvest framework (barley/wheat/grapes/olives) verbally developed and evaluated. 5 verbal-only items including temple sealing as Second Coming type and Nelson/Oaks Jewish calendar connections |
| 2 | [02_signs_and_warnings.md](02_signs_and_warnings.md) | Signs of the Times & Prophetic Warnings | **Slide-dependent** — Only "likening" method and Nelson leadership transition are verbal. 6 of 8 Key Claims (1 Nephi 14, D&C 88, JST Matthew, Woman at Well ~2034) exist only on slides |
| 3 | [03_apocalyptic_vision.md](03_apocalyptic_vision.md) | Grand Apocalyptic Vision & the Return | **Slide-dependent** — None of the 10 Key Claims are verbally presented as standalone discussion. Building blocks (Daniel 2, D&C 98/101, founding fathers) appear woven into Phases 4–5 verbally |
| 4 | [04_revelation_12.md](04_revelation_12.md) | Revelation 12 — Woman, Child & Dragon | **Best** — All 10 Key Claims verbally developed AND evaluated. JST Rev 12 as Restoration blueprint, Council of Fifty = man child, jubilee cycle 1847+175=2022. 3 minor verbal-only items |
| 5 | [05_ezekiels_eagle.md](05_ezekiels_eagle.md) | Ezekiel's Eagle & the Rebellious House | **Worst divergence** — Slides cover Ezekiel 17 (Hebrew word studies, Commerce IL, rebellious house); verbal delivery covers Revelation 13 beast identification of the United States. 18 unevaluated verbal items |
| 6 | [06_esdras_and_appointed_times.md](06_esdras_and_appointed_times.md) | Esdras, Daniel & Appointed Times | **Good** — Most claims verbal AND evaluated. 2 Esdras eagle = US politics, Hebrew mō·w·'ă·ḏîm, Palmyra Temple April 6 2000 astronomical claims, Howard W. Hunter = Samuel the Lamanite. 7 verbal-only items |
| 7 | [07_type_and_sign.md](07_type_and_sign.md) | 9/11, Pharmakeia & Year-by-Year Parallels | **Good core** — Year-by-year BoM→modern timeline, 9/11 = Rev 18, Lachoneus/Trump all captured. Pharmakeia word study (4 claims) is entirely slide-only. 7 verbal-only items |
| 8 | [08_harbinger_and_hinge.md](08_harbinger_and_hinge.md) | Isaiah's Harbinger, Hinge Point & Types of Judah | **Most slide-dependent** — All 4 major arguments (Palmyra/Jericho etymology, half-hour-of-silence calculation, D&C 112/COVID, Judah/governors mapping) have zero verbal presence. Excellent as slide analysis |
| 9 | [09_culmination.md](09_culmination.md) | Two Great Lights & Culmination | **Second-best** — 10/15 claims verbal AND evaluated. Speculative 2025–2033 timeline, three harvests, Wedding at Cana. Title section (Kokaubeam word study) is entirely slide-only; Zarahemla/Salt Lake etymology is verbal-only |

## Key Findings

### What Philpot Gets Right

- **Scriptural literacy is high.** He reads from JST, Leviticus 25, Daniel 2/7/12, 2 Esdras, Book of Mormon war chapters, and Revelation 12–13 with genuine fluency. These aren't proof-texts yanked out of context — he's working with extended passages.
- **The harvest framework is his strongest original contribution.** Mapping Leviticus 23 feasts to agricultural seasons to dispensational phases is creative, scripturally grounded, and instructive regardless of whether his specific timeline dates hold up.
- **Hebrew and Greek word studies add genuine depth.** The Zarahemla/hemlah (salt) etymology, the mō·w·'ă·ḏîm (appointed times) study, and several others show real engagement with the source languages.
- **He models a principle worth emulating:** "Everything I do is not intended to convince you I'm right. I probably am. But it's intended to stimulate your mind to think about how to liken the scriptures to us in a very extreme way."

### Where the Evaluations Push Back

- **Date-setting crosses a prophetic line.** D&C 49:7 ("the hour and the day no man knoweth") and Matthew 24:36 stand as scriptural guardrails that specific dates like "2022 endpoint" or "2029 assassination" or "2033 destruction" must be measured against.
- **Unfalsifiable year-by-year parallels.** The 130-row BoM→modern timeline is the interpretive heart of the presentation but fails the test of falsifiability — any modern event can be pattern-matched to any ancient narrative with enough creativity.
- **Ezekiel 17 eisegesis.** The eagle-and-vine riddle in Ezekiel 17 is *self-interpreting* (vv. 11–21 explain vv. 1–10), yet Philpot maps it onto American Restoration history instead of its stated referent: Zedekiah, Nebuchadnezzar, and Egypt.
- **Slide-only claims never tested by audience.** Approximately 40% of evaluated content exists only on slides that were shown but never discussed. The audience accepted the visual architecture of charts and timelines without hearing the verbal reasoning.

### The Slide/Verbal Disconnect

The most significant finding of the transcript review: **Philpot's slides represent an older, more comprehensive body of work than any single 3-hour presentation can cover.** With 50+ presentations given over time, his verbal delivery has evolved — becoming sharper, more doctrinally solid, and more audience-responsive — while the 369-slide deck remains largely unchanged.

This creates three distinct presentational layers:
1. **Slide-only** — shown but never spoken (Kokaubeam, Ezekiel 17, pharmakeia, Palmyra/Jericho, half-hour calculation, Judah/governors, and most of Phases 2–3)
2. **Slide-and-verbal** — shown AND discussed (harvest framework, Revelation 12, 9/11, year-by-year timeline, 2025–2033 projections)
3. **Verbal-only** — spoken but never on slides (~70 items across all phases, including some of his most compelling arguments: temple sealing typology, Zarahemla etymology, corporate fiction argument, Oaks' first talk analysis)

## Methodology

Each phase evaluation follows the [Video Evaluation workflow](../../../.github/copilot-instructions.md):

1. **Discovery** — Search tools (gospel-mcp, gospel-vec) find relevant scriptures and talks
2. **Deep Reading** — `read_file` the actual chapter/talk files before quoting anything
3. **Writing** — Synthesize with verified quotes and proper markdown links
4. **Verification** — Quote verification pass against source files

Each evaluation uses a 5-step framework:
- **Step 1: Summary** — Main thesis, key claims, scriptures cited
- **Step 2: Deep Reading Checklist** — Track which sources were actually read
- **Step 3: Assessment** — In Line / Nuanced / Out of Line / Missed the Mark / Missed Opportunities
- **Step 4: Overall Assessment** — Synthesis with cautions and recommendations
- **Step 5: Become** — Personal application: truths, warnings, commitments

The transcript review (10 passes) then compared each evaluation against the actual verbal delivery, documenting slide-vs-verbal gaps and ~70 verbal-only items.

## Presenter Context

Morgan Philpot is a constitutional attorney, former Utah state legislator, and member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He has delivered over 50 presentations in this "Signs of the Times" series. Each iteration has refined his verbal delivery — becoming more focused and doctrinally grounded — while the slide deck has remained largely static. The Chandler 2025 presentation evaluated here represents a mature point in that evolution.
