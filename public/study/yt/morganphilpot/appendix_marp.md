# Signs of the Times — Appendix
## Slide-Only Content

Material from Morgan Philpot's 369-slide deck that was **never verbally discussed** in the three Chandler presentations.

Organized by topic for reference and further study.

<!--
These slides appear in the original slides.md but were not covered in any of the three video transcripts (Parts I–III). They represent ~40% of the total slide deck.

<!-- _class: title -->

# Appendix A
## Signs & Prophetic Warnings
*Original slides 40–92 (Phase 2)*

---

## "Front-Row Seats" — Nelson, 2020

> "We have front-row seats to witness live what the prophet Nephi saw only in vision.… You, my brothers and sisters, are among those men, women, and children whom Nephi saw. Think of that!"

— Russell M. Nelson, "Hear Him," *Ensign*, May 2020

<!--
Original slide 41. Sets the frame: we are the generation Nephi saw.
-->

---

## What Nephi Saw — 1 Nephi 14:11–14

> "I beheld the whore of all the earth, and she sat upon many waters; and she had dominion over all the earth" (v. 11)

> "I beheld that the church of the Lamb… its numbers were few… nevertheless… their dominions upon the face of the earth were small" (v. 12)

> "The power of the Lamb of God… descended upon the saints… and they were armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory" (v. 14)

Two churches. One small but armed with power. One vast but destined for wrath.

<!-- Original slides 42–44 -->

---

## The Power of the Lamb — Nelson

> "In coming days, we will see the greatest manifestations of the Savior's power that the world has ever seen."

<!-- Original slide 45 -->

---

## The Wrath of God — D&C 88:85

> "That their souls may escape the wrath of God, the desolation of abomination" — D&C 88:84–85

1 Nephi 14:15–17 — Wars and rumors of wars among the nations of the mother of abominations. When the wrath is poured out, "the work of the Father shall commence."

<!-- Original slides 46–48. The slides reference Rev 15–16 as the wrath mechanism. -->

---

## Recent Prophetic Warnings — A Timeline

| Date | Quote (President Nelson) |
|------|-------------------------|
| Apr. 2018 | "It will not be possible to survive spiritually without… the Holy Ghost" |
| Oct. 2018 | "Together we can do all that our Heavenly Father needs us to do to prepare the world for the Second Coming" |
| Apr. 2019 | "Do the spiritual work to find out for yourselves, and please do it now. Time is running out" |
| Apr. 2019 | Rome Temple = "a hinge point in the history of the Church" |
| Oct. 2020 | "Men's hearts [would fail] them… even the very elect would be at risk" |
| Apr. 2021 | "Commotion in the world will continue to increase" |
| Oct. 2021 | SLC Temple: "Unprecedented times call for unprecedented measures" |
| Apr. 2022 | "We have never needed positive spiritual momentum more" |

<!-- Original slides 50–58. Entirely slide-only — never read aloud in any of the three videos, though Nelson's warnings are briefly mentioned in Part III verbally. -->

---

## JST Matthew — The Tribulation Sequence

> "And again shall the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, be fulfilled" — JST Matt. 1:32

> "Immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light" — JST Matt. 1:33

**"What tribulation?"** — The slide asks the audience to identify which tribulation precedes these cosmic signs.

<!-- Original slides 63–65 -->

---

## D&C 88: The Testimony Sequence

| Step | D&C 88 |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Saints labor among Gentiles (v. 84) |
| 2 | After testimony → wrath and indignation (v. 88) |
| 3 | Testimony of earthquakes (v. 89) |
| 4 | Thunderings, lightnings, tempests, waves (v. 90) |
| 5 | All things in commotion; men's hearts fail (v. 91) |

<!-- Original slides 67–68 -->

---

## Jacob & the Latter-Day Gentiles — 2 Nephi 6

> "I would speak unto you concerning things which are, and which are to come" (v. 4)

> "I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles" (v. 6)

> "Blessed are the Gentiles… if it so be that they shall repent and fight not against Zion" (v. 12)

> "They that believe not in him shall be destroyed, both by fire, and by tempest, and by earthquakes, and by bloodsheds, and by pestilence, and by famine" (v. 15)

Jacob's warning to the Nephites *about* the Gentiles — and by extension, *to* us.

<!-- Original slides 70–73 -->

---

## 3 Nephi 8–10: The Destruction Type

> "There arose a great storm, such an one as never had been known" — 3 Nephi 8:5

> "Behold, that great city Zarahemla have I burned with fire" — 3 Nephi 9:3

> "Whoso readeth, let him understand… all these deaths and destructions… are not unto the fulfilling of the prophecies" — 3 Nephi 10:14

Mormon's editorial: **"Who is Mormon talking to?"** — The reader. Us.

<!-- Original slides 74–77 -->

---

## Woman at the Well — John 4

> "The hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father" — John 4:21

**34 AD + 2 days with the Samaritans** — The slide implies a typological calculation: Christ spent two days (= 2,000 years?) with the Samaritans (= Gentiles?) before continuing to Galilee (= the gathering?).

<!-- Original slides 81–85. Creative typological reading. -->

---

## Walk to Emmaus — Luke 24

> "O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken" — Luke 24:25

> "Beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself" — Luke 24:27

The resurrected Christ teaches two disciples by walking through Moses and the prophets. The slide pairs this with D&C 121:28 — "nothing shall be withheld."

<!-- Original slides 86–92 -->

---

## D&C 121 — Nothing Withheld

> "All thrones and dominions, principalities and powers, shall be revealed and set forth upon all who have endured valiantly" — D&C 121:29

> "All the times of their revolutions, all the appointed days, months, and years… shall be revealed in the days of the dispensation of the fulness of times" — D&C 121:31

The astronomical signs framework: God's appointed times are written in the heavens, and in the fulness of times, the code will be fully readable.

<!-- Original slides 91–92 -->

---

<!-- _class: title -->

# Appendix B
## Grand Apocalyptic Vision
*Original slides 93–120 (Phase 3)*

---

## The Grand Apocalyptic Vision — Overview

**Amos 3:7** — "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets."

Five prophetic visions that tell the same story:

1. **Nephi** (1 Nephi 13–14)
2. **John** (Revelation 12)
3. **Ezekiel** (Ezekiel 17)
4. **Esdras** (2 Esdras 11)
5. **Daniel** (Daniel 7)

<!-- Original slides 93–99 -->

---

## Established & Set Up — The Constitutional Framework

> "They should be established in this land, and be set up as a free people by the power of the Father" — 3 Nephi 21:4

The slides build a patriarchal reading of the US Constitution:

| Constitutional Phrase | Priesthood Function | Family Proclamation |
|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| "establish Justice" | Presiding | "fathers are to preside" |
| "insure domestic Tranquility" | Protecting | "responsible to… protection" |
| "provide for the common defence" | Protecting | — |
| "promote the general Welfare" | Providing | "provide the necessities of life" |
| "secure the Blessings of Liberty" | Presiding | — |

<!-- Original slides 100–106. Most creative constitutional interpretation in the entire deck. -->

---

## The Deuteronomy Covenant Pattern

> "If thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God… the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations" — Deut. 28:1–2

> "These are the words of the covenant, which the Lord commanded Moses… with him that is not here with us this day" — Deut. 29:1, 14–15

The covenant extends beyond Moses' audience — to future generations, including us.

<!-- Original slides 108, 112–113 -->

---

## The Return — Feast Day Chronology

| Date | Event | Jewish Calendar |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Sept. 21, 1823 | Moroni appears to Joseph | Feast of Tabernacles (possibly Shmita year) |
| Sept. 22, 1827 | Gold plates delivered | Rosh Hashanah — Feast of Trumpets |

> "Return unto me, and I will return unto you" — Malachi 3 (as quoted by Moroni, JS-H 1:36)

<!-- Original slides 114–117 -->

---

## 1 Nephi 14:25–27 — The Handoff to John

> "The things which thou shalt see hereafter thou shalt not write; for the Lord God hath ordained the apostle of the Lamb of God that he should write them" — 1 Nephi 14:25

Nephi's vision continues beyond what he wrote — John the Revelator received the assignment to record the rest.

<!-- Original slide 120 -->

---

<!-- _class: title -->

# Appendix C
## Ezekiel's Eagle
*Original slides 149–186 (Phase 5)*

---

## Revelation 12:14 → Ezekiel 17

> "The woman was given two wings of a great eagle" — Rev. 12:14

**Where can we find the rest of the story?** The slide deck answers: Ezekiel 17.

<!-- Original slides 149–152 -->

---

## The Eagle with Divers Colours

> "A great eagle with great wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had **divers colours**, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar" — Ezek. 17:3

**Divers colours** = Joseph's coat of many colours (Gen. 37:3). The eagle represents the Josephite lineage.

> "Out of the fruit of his loins the Lord God would raise up a righteous branch" — 2 Nephi 3:5

<!-- Original slides 153–156 -->

---

## The Land of Traffick — Hebrew Word Study

> "He carried it into **a land of traffick**; he set it in **a city of merchants**" — Ezek. 17:4

| Hebrew | Transliteration | Meaning |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| כְּנָ֑עַן | kə·nā·'an | Canaan — "traffick" |
| רֹכְלִ֖ים | rō·ḵə·lîm | merchants/traders |

**Cainan → Canaan chain** (Moses 6:14–17): The land of Cainan was named after Enos' son, a land where "Satan had great dominion."

**City of merchants** = Commerce, Illinois → later renamed Nauvoo (D&C 124 header).

<!-- Original slides 157–163 -->

---

## The Vine, the Other Eagle, and the East Wind

> "It grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature" — Ezek. 17:6

> "There was also **another great eagle**" — Ezek. 17:7

> "Shall it not utterly wither, when the **east wind** toucheth it?" — Ezek. 17:10

The east wind = famine/judgment. Pharaoh's dream (Gen. 41:23): seven ears "blasted with the east wind" = seven years of famine.

**Hinckley, Oct. 2001:** "I cannot forget the great lesson of Pharaoh's dream of the fat and lean kine…. I do not wish to be an alarmist."

<!-- Original slides 164–171 -->

---

## The Rebellious House — Alfred Cumming

> "Say now to the **rebellious house**, Know ye not what these things mean? Behold, **the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem**" — Ezek. 17:12

**1858:** Alfred Cumming appointed Governor of Utah Territory by President Buchanan. The "king of Babylon" comes to "Jerusalem" (= Salt Lake City).

<!-- Original slides 172–173 -->

---

## That the Kingdom Might Be Base (1862–1896)

> "That the kingdom might be **base**, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand" — Ezek. 17:14

A sequence of political subjugation:
- **1862** — Heber C. Kimball told by revelation: Congress will "reject the Saints"
- **1887** — Edmunds-Tucker Act: "the most unconstitutional Law Ever past" (Woodruff)
- **1893** — Official Declaration 1: Woodruff stops polygamy to save temples
- **1896** — Utah statehood: polygamy "forever prohibited," public lands disclaimed, sectarian-free schools required

<!-- Original slides 174–183 -->

---

## Birthright Forfeited

> **Birthright** — "Under the patriarchal order, the right or inheritance of the firstborn… generally included a land inheritance as well as the authority to preside." — Bible Dictionary

The 1896 Utah Constitution required:
1. Polygamy forever prohibited
2. All public lands disclaimed
3. Schools free from sectarian control

**Land + Authority** — The very definition of birthright, surrendered.

<!-- Original slides 184–185 -->

---

<!-- _class: title -->

# Appendix D
## Pharmakeia & Isaiah's Warning
*Original slides 269–298 (Phase 7)*

---

## D&C 89:4 — Conspiring Men

> "In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of **conspiring men** in the last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation"

<!-- Original slide 269 -->

---

## Φαρμακεία — Pharmakeia

> "By thy **sorceries** were all nations deceived" — Rev. 18:23

| Greek | Transliteration | Meaning |
|-------|-----------------|---------|
| φαρμακείᾳ | pharmakeia | "the use of medicine, drugs or spells" |
| — | Strong's 5331 | "drug-related sorcery, like the practice of magical-arts" |

**Webster 1828:** SORCERY = "Magic; enchantment; witchcraft; divination by the assistance or supposed assistance of evil spirits"

**Webster 1828:** PHARMACOLOGY = "The science or knowledge of drugs, or the art of preparing medicines"

John sees a time when Babylon's merchants deceive all nations with **pharmakeia**.

<!-- Original slides 274–276 -->

---

## Isaiah 8:19 — Wizards That Peep

> "Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter" — Isaiah 8:19

**Webster 1828:**
- WIZARD = "A conjurer; an enchanter; a sorcerer"
- ENCHANTER = "one who has spirits or demons at his command; one who practices enchantment"

Isaiah and John see the same era — practitioners of pharmakeia and demonic prognostication.

<!-- Original slides 277–278 -->

---

## Revelation 18:6 — Double unto Her Double

> "Reward her even as she rewarded you, and **double unto her double** according to her works" — Rev. 18:6

| Greek | Transliteration | Meaning |
|-------|-----------------|---------|
| διπλώσατε | diplōsate | "pay back double" |
| διπλᾶ | dipla | "twofold" |

<!-- Original slide 242. The Greek wordplay: pay-double-the-double. -->

---

## Isaiah 9–10: The 24-Year Harbinger Framework

> "The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the sycomores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars" — Isaiah 9:10

The Assyrian conquest of the Northern Kingdom took **24 years** (744–721 BC).

| Isaiah Event | Modern Parallel |
|-------------|----------------|
| Tower falls | 9/11 (2001) |
| Leaders invoke defiance (Isa. 9:10) | Daschle quotes Isaiah 9:10 on Sept. 12, 2001 |
| Pride replaces repentance | Rebuilt with "hewn stones" (One WTC, 2011 beam signing) |
| Assyria sent as rod of anger | Isaiah 10:5–6: "O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger" |
| 24-year window | 2001 + 24 = 2025 |

<!-- Original slides 286–297. The most detailed framework in the entire slide deck. -->

---

<!-- _class: title -->

# Appendix E
## Harbinger & Hinge
*Original slides 298–355 (Phase 8)*

---

## Palmyra = Jericho — Etymology

> **Palmyra** — "city of palm trees" (Roman name, 1st century CE)

> "The children of the Kenite… went up out of the **city of palm trees**" — Judges 1:16

The **City of Palm Trees** in the Old Testament is **Jericho** — the lowest city on earth, the city Christ passed through the day before Palm Sunday.

**Jericho → Palm Sunday → Hosanna → Temple Dedication**

The Palmyra Temple sitting at the site of the Restoration mirrors Jericho sitting at the entrance to the Promised Land.

<!-- Original slides 299–307 -->

---

## Palmyra Temple — April 6, 2000

| Fact | Significance |
|------|-------------|
| April 6, 2000 | 1st day of 1st month (1 Nisan) |
| 7th day of Passover | Tradition: Red Sea parted on 7th day |
| Also: Day Christ died | Mark 15:33–34 |
| 170 years from Church organization | — |
| 180 years from First Vision | — |
| First temple dedication broadcast worldwide | 1.5 million members participated |

> "I regard this temple as perhaps the most significant, in one respect, in the entire Church." — President Hinckley

<!-- Original slides 308–312 -->

---

## Astronomical Signs — D&C 88 & Psalm 19

> "The heavens declare the glory of God" — Psalm 19:1

> "Their line is gone out through all the earth" — Psalm 19:4

> "So then faith cometh by hearing" — Romans 10:17–18 (quoting Psalm 19:4)

The heavens **speak**. D&C 88:42–49 — God "hath given a law unto all things, by which they move in their times and their seasons."

**"In 2000, Did We Hear Them?"**

<!-- Original slides 228–237. The astrological alignment data for April 5–6, 2000 in Palmyra is presented in the original slides with star charts. -->

---

## The Half-Hour Calculation

> "When he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of **half an hour**" — Rev. 8:1

1,000 years ÷ 24 hours = 41.67 years per hour
41.67 ÷ 2 = **20.83 years** = half an hour

April 6, 2000 + 20.8 years ≈ **October 19–29, 2020**

> "All flesh is corrupted before me; and the powers of darkness prevail upon the earth… which causeth **silence** to reign" — D&C 38:11–12

<!-- Original slide 321–322. The most controversial calculation in the entire presentation. -->

---

## The Seventh Seal Sequence

1. Seventh Seal opened (Palmyra dedication, April 6, 2000)
2. Silence for half an hour (~20.8 years → Oct. 2020)
3. Judgments begin (2001 as warning type, 2020 as pandemic)
4. Vials of Revelation 16 bring down Babylon
5. Revelation 18 = the final fall of ALL Babylon
6. 1 Nephi 14:11–12 — Nephi sees this same moment

<!-- Original slide 323 -->

---

## D&C 112:24–25 — Upon My House

> "Vengeance cometh speedily upon the inhabitants of the earth, a day of wrath, a day of burning, a day of desolation" — D&C 112:24

> "**And upon my house shall it begin, and from my house shall it go forth**, saith the Lord" — D&C 112:25

The COVID temple closures (March 2020) as the fulfillment: judgment begins with the Lord's house.

<!-- Original slides 346–347. Timeline of March 2020 closures presented in slides 337–348. -->

---

## COVID Temple Closure Timeline (Slide Summary)

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Mar. 5, 2020 | Rome Temple first in Europe to close |
| Mar. 11, 2020 | WHO declares pandemic; April conference restricted |
| Mar. 12, 2020 | Utah restricts gatherings >100; Church suspends worldwide |
| Mar. 13, 2020 | U.S. declares national emergency |
| Mar. 15, 2020 | Members worship at home for the first time |
| Mar. 16–18, 2020 | Historic sites close; missionaries return home |
| Mar. 19, 2020 | Spring equinox |

<!-- Original slides 337–348. Detailed day-by-day timeline. -->

---

## Types & Shadows — Judah's Kings → Utah's Governors

The slides map all 20 kings of ancient Judah to Utah's governors in sequence:

| King | Governor | Notable |
|------|----------|---------|
| Rehoboam (#1) | Heber Wells (1896) | First after statehood |
| Hezekiah (#13) | Bangerter (1985) | — |
| Josiah (#16) | Huntsman Jr. (2005) | — |
| Jehoiakim (#18) | Spencer Cox (2021–) | — |
| Jehoiachin (#19) | *Future* | Nebuchadnezzar seizes Jerusalem |
| Zedekiah (#20) | *Future* | Kingdom overthrown |

**The implication:** Two governors remain before the "Babylonian" takeover.

<!-- Original slides 329–335. Entirely slide-only. -->

---

<!-- _class: title -->

# Appendix F
## Two Great Lights & Eclipses
*Original slides 356–369 (Phase 9)*

---

## Genesis 1:16 — Two Great Lights

> "And God made two great lights; the **greater light** to rule the day, and the **lesser light** to rule the night: he made the stars also" — Genesis 1:16

The slides build a chiastic reading: the "two great lights" as types of Christ's two appearances.

<!-- Original slide 357 -->

---

## Helaman 14 — Samuel's Prophecy

> "There shall be one day and a night and a day, as if it were one day and there were no night… the sun shall shine forth… and also the moon and the stars; and there shall be no darkness in the night" — Helaman 14:4

> "But behold, as I said unto you concerning another sign, a sign of his death… the sun shall be darkened and refuse to give his light" — Helaman 14:20

**Birth** = light without darkness | **Death** = darkness without light

<!-- Original slides 358–359 -->

---

## Isaiah 13 — The Day of the Lord

> "Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate" — Isaiah 13:9

> "For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine" — Isaiah 13:10

The cosmic signs attend the Day of the Lord — not merely astronomical events, but divine signals.

<!-- Original slides 360–361 -->

---

## Kokaubeam — Abraham 3:13, 16

> "And he said unto me: This is Shinehah, which is the sun. And he said unto me: **Kokob**, which is star. And he said unto me: Olea, which is the moon" — Abraham 3:13

> "If two things exist, and there be one above the other, there shall be greater things above them; therefore **Kolob** is the greatest of all the **Kokaubeam** that thou hast seen" — Abraham 3:16

| Term | Meaning | Hebrew Connection |
|------|---------|------------------|
| Kokob | star | kō-w-ḵāḇ (כוכב) |
| Kokaubeam | "all the great lights" | hak-kō-w-ḵā-ḇîm (הכוכבים) |

<!-- Original slides 363–365 -->

---

## The Star of Bethlehem — Numbers 24:17

> "There shall come a **Star** out of Jacob, and a **Sceptre** shall rise out of Israel" — Numbers 24:17

> "Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen **his star** in the east" — Matthew 2:1–2

The Kokaubeam word study connects Abraham's astronomy to Balaam's prophecy to the Magi's star — a continuous thread from the premortal council to Bethlehem to the Second Coming.

<!-- Original slides 366–367. The final slides of the original deck. -->

---

## Solar Eclipses — The Modern Signs

| Date | Eclipse | Significance |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Aug. 21, 2017 | Total eclipse, Oregon → South Carolina | First coast-to-coast since 1918 |
| Apr. 8, 2024 | Total eclipse, Texas → Maine | Crosses 2017 path at "X" over southern Illinois |

The two eclipse paths form an **X** over the United States — the slides position this as a cosmic sign visible to the entire nation.

> "The sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven" — Matthew 24:29

<!-- Original slide 356 + context from slides 273, 313. -->
