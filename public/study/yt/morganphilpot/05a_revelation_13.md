# Phase 5a: Revelation 13 — The Beast-Kingdom Argument (Verbal Only)

> Morgan Philpot — *Signs of the Times* (Chandler, AZ, 2025)
> Part I Transcript (~34:39–1:24:00) | No corresponding slides

**Why this document exists:** The [Phase 5 evaluation](05_ezekiels_eagle.md) assessed the *slide* content — Ezekiel 17's "riddle and parable" about eagles, Commerce, and the rebellious house. But the Ezekiel 17 material was **never spoken**. From ~34:39 to 1:24:00, the audience heard a completely different argument: a verse-by-verse identification of the United States as the beast of Revelation 13. This document evaluates what the audience actually heard.

**Bias Alert:** Revelation 13 is notoriously resistant to definitive interpretation — every generation has identified the beast with contemporary powers. The temptation is either to dismiss the entire enterprise as misguided or to get swept up in the pattern-matching. Evaluate the internal logic and scriptural grounding of each claim on its own terms.

## Step 1: Summary

### Main Thesis

Philpot argues that the beast of [Revelation 13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/13?lang=eng) is the US government — not at its founding, but after its moral transformation through slavery and the murder of Joseph Smith. He separates the "eagle" (the divinely sanctioned pre-1830 America of [D&C 98](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98?lang=eng) and [D&C 101:80](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101?lang=eng&id=p80#p80)) from the "beast" (the post-Joseph, post-slavery entity that opposes the Saints). He walks verse-by-verse through Revelation 13:1–17, mapping each symbol to American history from the Civil War through the 20th century.

### Key Claims

1. **Eagle ≠ Beast** — The pre-1830 US (eagle) is divinely sanctioned per D&C 98/101. The beast emerges later, after the nation sheds innocent blood (Joseph Smith) and enslaves people.
2. **Seven Heads = Seven Dispensational Beast Kingdoms** — One beast per dispensation (Adam through Joseph); the seventh is "perfected" — all prior beast powers combined.
3. **Beast Has All Powers of Previous Beasts** (Rev 13:2) — Babylon + Medes/Persians + Greece + Rome combined into one superpower.
4. **Civil War = Deadly Wound Healed** (Rev 13:3) — America appeared mortally divided; the wound was healed after Lincoln's assassination.
5. **42 Months = Emancipation to Lee's Surrender** (Rev 13:5) — Claimed as 42 months. *(Actual calculation: Jan 1, 1863 to Apr 9, 1865 ≈ 27 months.)*
6. **America Overcomes the Saints** (Rev 13:7) — Post-Civil War persecution: Edmunds-Tucker, criminalizing polygamy, overcoming the Saints politically and legally.
7. **10 Horns = 10 Post-Lincoln Presidents through Taft** — Andrew Johnson (1) through William Howard Taft (10).
8. **1907 Church Declaration = Surrender** — Church declares loyalty to the US government with conditional language Philpot reads as a "predicated" ultimatum.
9. **Two-Horned Beast = Wilson/Harding = Two-Party Control** (Rev 13:11) — Lamb-like creature with two horns inaugurates total Republican/Democrat control.
10. **Fire from Heaven = Nuclear Weapons** (Rev 13:13) — Hiroshima and Nagasaki as literal fulfillment.
11. **Image of the Beast = Propaganda/Intelligence Community** (Rev 13:14–15) — The beast gives "life" to its own image through propaganda and the rise of the CIA/intelligence apparatus.
12. **Mark of the Beast = Financial/Monetary System** (Rev 13:16–17) — Control of monetary policy; nobody can buy or sell outside the system.
13. **Daniel 2 Toes = Specific Presidents** — Washington through the 10th "toe" on March 11, 1844 (Council of Fifty organized).
14. **Cain/Abel = Government Authority** — Cain kills with a stone (apocryphal) = usurping governmental authority. Temple parallels claimed.
15. **Hamilton/Central Banking Narrative** — First Bank → War of 1812 → Second Bank → Jackson's veto → depression → targeting South + Mormons.
16. **"Twin Relics of Barbarism"** — 1856 Republican platform linking slavery and polygamy.
17. **"Blood Oath Between the Devil and the US"** — Murder of Joseph + slavery = the nation's Cain-like covenant with evil.
18. **D&C 87: "Full End of All Nations"** — The Lord (not armies) will bring down the beast.

## Step 3: Evaluation

### In Line

**1. The Beast = Government Distinction Is Textually Sound**

Philpot's most important hermeneutic move is distinguishing the beast from the devil. He says: "I always thought the beast was the devil. This is clearly not the devil. This is a government."

Revelation 13:1–2 confirms this: "the *dragon* gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority." The dragon (Satan, per [Rev 12:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/12?lang=eng&id=p9#p9)) empowers the beast — they are not the same entity. The beast is an earthly political power animated by satanic influence. This reading is standard among biblical scholars across traditions. Getting this right matters because it frames the entire discussion: the beast is a governmental system, not a supernatural being.

**2. The Composite Beast Echoes Daniel 7 — By Design**

Revelation 13:2 says the beast "was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion." These are the exact animals from [Daniel 7:3–7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/7?lang=eng&id=p3-p7#p3) — the lion, bear, and leopard — but in *reverse* order. John is deliberately echoing Daniel's four-beast sequence. This connection is not Philpot's invention; it is recognized by virtually all commentators. The beast of Revelation 13 is a *synthesis* of all the empires Daniel saw. Philpot is correct that John's beast consolidates the powers of prior kingdoms.

**3. "Twin Relics of Barbarism" Is Historically Accurate**

The 1856 Republican platform did describe slavery and polygamy as "those twin relics of barbarism." This is a documented historical fact. The political linkage between abolition and anti-polygamy campaigns is well-established in American history. Philpot is on solid ground here.

**4. D&C 87 Does Prophesy War Beginning at South Carolina**

> "Verily, thus saith the Lord concerning the wars that will shortly come to pass, beginning at the rebellion of South Carolina" — [D&C 87:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/87?lang=eng&id=p1#p1)

Given December 25, 1832, this is one of Joseph Smith's most dramatically fulfilled prophecies. The Civil War did begin with South Carolina's secession. Philpot correctly invokes this as evidence that the Lord foresaw the national conflict.

**5. D&C 98:7 and D&C 101:80 Create Genuine Theological Tension**

Philpot frames the argument well: if the Lord says "I established the Constitution... by the hands of wise men" ([D&C 101:80](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101?lang=eng&id=p80#p80)) and "whatsoever is more or less than this, cometh of evil" ([D&C 98:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98?lang=eng&id=p7#p7)), then departures from constitutional principles (slavery, persecution of the Saints) really do invoke the Lord's own standard of judgment. The tension between a divinely sanctioned government and its unjust actions is real, and the scriptures Philpot cites are the right ones to raise it.

**6. The Historical Persecution of the Saints Is Real**

The murder of Joseph Smith (1844), the expulsion from Nauvoo (1846), the Utah War (1857–58), the Edmunds-Tucker Act (1887), the federal escheating of Church property, the criminalizing of polygamy and disenfranchisement of Church members — these are documented historical events. Philpot is not inventing persecution. The Book of Mormon's own language — "make war with the saints, and... overcome them" (Rev 13:7 / [3 Nephi 7:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/7?lang=eng&id=p1#p1)) — does map onto real historical experiences.

---

### Nuanced

**1. Seven Heads = Seven Dispensations — Creative but Unverifiable**

Philpot's reading — one beast per dispensation (Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Peter, Joseph) — is a novel theological construct. It has internal logic: just as the Church existed in different forms across dispensations, opposition to the Church could have taken different forms. He notes there are seven churches in Revelation (chapters 2–3) and proposes seven corresponding beasts.

**What complicates this:** Revelation 17:9–10 identifies the seven heads: "The seven heads are seven mountains" and "there are seven kings." The standard interpretation (both ancient and modern) identifies these as seven specific kingdoms or rulers, not dispensational epochs. The five "fallen" kings are typically read as Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, and Greece; the sixth "is" (Rome); and the seventh "is not yet come." Philpot's dispensational reading replaces specific historical kingdoms with a theological framework of his own design.

**Assessment:** The idea is provocative and has a certain elegance. But it lacks textual or prophetic support — no prophet or apostle has taught a seven-dispensation beast schema. It should be heard as a creative theological hypothesis, not as exegesis.

**2. 10 Horns = 10 Presidents — Structurally Interesting, Historically Forced**

Philpot maps the 10 horns of Revelation 13:1 to 10 American presidents from Andrew Johnson through William Howard Taft. He counts Lincoln as the transition point (the "one who gets killed"), not as a horn.

**What works:** The idea of counting from a transformative moment (Lincoln's assassination as the "deadly wound") has structural logic. The horns follow the beast, and if the beast is the post-Civil War United States, then counting post-Civil War presidents as "horns" has internal consistency.

**What doesn't work:** There are 11 presidents from Lincoln's death through Taft's presidency: Johnson, Grant, Hayes, Garfield, Arthur, Cleveland (1st), Harrison, Cleveland (2nd), McKinley, T. Roosevelt, Taft. Philpot says "Don't count them again" at number 8, likely treating Cleveland's non-consecutive terms as one horn. But this is ad hoc: if horns represent presidencies, Cleveland served *two separate terms* with a different president between them. The count requires special pleading.

Additionally, [Daniel 7:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/7?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) says "the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and *another* shall rise after them." The "another" (little horn) is distinct from the ten. If Philpot follows Daniel's schema, who is the little horn after Taft? He transitions to Wilson/Harding as the "two-horned beast" (Rev 13:11), mixing the Daniel 7 and Revelation 13 frameworks rather than following either consistently.

**3. Fire from Heaven = Nuclear Weapons — A Common but Problematic Reading**

The idea of interpreting Revelation 13:13 ("maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men") as nuclear weapons is not original to Philpot — it has appeared in popular prophecy literature for decades. It has a visceral persuasiveness: the US is the only nation to have used nuclear weapons in war.

**What complicates this:** The verse is about the *second* beast (Rev 13:11, the two-horned earth beast), not the first beast (the sea beast). If the two-horned beast represents Wilson/Harding and the two-party system, then "fire from heaven" is a power of that political *system*, not of a specific military action. The nuclear bombings were ordered by Truman (1945), not Wilson or Harding. The timeline doesn't track cleanly within Philpot's own framework.

Also, reading "fire from heaven" as literal weapons rather than signs or wonders (which is how John uses similar language elsewhere — cf. [1 Kings 18:38](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/18?lang=eng&id=p38#p38), Elijah calling fire) flattens the apocalyptic genre into literalism selectively. Philpot reads seven heads as symbolic dispensations but fire from heaven as literal nukes. The interpretive method is inconsistent.

---

### Out of Line

**1. The 42-Month Claim Is Mathematically Wrong**

Philpot states: "From the date of the emancipation proclamation to the surrender of Lee was 42 months."

The dates:
- Emancipation Proclamation: **January 1, 1863**
- Lee's surrender at Appomattox: **April 9, 1865**
- Duration: **27 months and 8 days**

Alternative calculations:
- Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation (Sep 22, 1862) to Lee's surrender: **~30.5 months**
- Fort Sumter (Apr 12, 1861) to Lee's surrender: **~48 months**

No reasonable pairing of Civil War dates produces 42 months. Philpot may be confusing dates or borrowing the number from Revelation 13:5 and retrofitting it onto the Civil War timeline. This is the kind of verifiable factual claim that undermines credibility when it fails — and it fails here. The number 42 appears to have been imported from the scripture into the history rather than derived from the history independently.

**2. Daniel 2 Toes = Specific Presidents Is Eisegesis**

Philpot maps the ten toes of Nebuchadnezzar's image ([Daniel 2:42](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/2?lang=eng&id=p42#p42)) to specific US presidents: Washington through the 10th president, with Joseph Smith born during the 3rd, the First Vision during the 4th, the gold plates during the 5th/6th, the Church organized during the 7th, and the Council of Fifty organized during the 10th (March 11, 1844).

[Daniel 2:44](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/2?lang=eng&id=p44#p44) says: "In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed." The standard LDS reading (taught by every prophet from Joseph Smith to Russell M. Nelson) identifies this kingdom as the Church of Jesus Christ restored in 1830, and the "days of these kings" as the era of divided kingdoms (the iron/clay mixture). The toes are not interpreted in Daniel's text as specific individuals — they represent a *condition* (partly strong, partly broken, v. 42) of the final kingdom era.

Mapping toes to specific presidents requires importing an interpretive grid that the text does not support and that no authoritative LDS source teaches.

**3. Cain Killing with a Stone — Claimed as Apocryphal but Unverifiable**

Philpot says "Cain kills with a stone. … It's not in the Old Testament. It's in apocryphal works." He then builds a government-authority argument on this: killing by stoning = governmental execution = Cain usurped governmental authority.

The Genesis account ([Genesis 4:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/4?lang=eng&id=p8#p8)) says only "Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him" — no weapon is specified. Various extrabiblical traditions (Jubilees, some Islamic traditions, some patristic texts) have offered different murder weapons. But claiming "we learn this in the temple" alongside an apocryphal weapon detail creates the impression of authoritative temple teaching supporting the interpretation. Temple content is sacred and should not be selectively invoked to prop up a speculative argument about government authority.

**4. Archduke Ferdinand Claims Are Historically Confused**

In the transcript, Philpot says "Communists killed Archduke Ferdinand" and implies Ferdinand "wanted to transition Russia from a monarchy to a constitutional republic."

Archduke Franz Ferdinand was heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, not Russian. He was assassinated by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb nationalist affiliated with the Black Hand — not a communist. These are basic historical facts. While the assassination did trigger WWI (which eventually contributed to conditions for the Russian Revolution and communism's rise), the direct claim about communists assassinating Ferdinand is incorrect. Getting basic historical facts wrong in a presentation that depends on historical accuracy undermines the broader argument.

**5. The "Blood Oath" Framework Overreaches**

Philpot's thesis that America entered a "blood oath" with the devil through slavery and murdering Joseph Smith is emotionally powerful but theologically problematic. The scriptures he cites — D&C 98:7 ("more or less than this, cometh of evil") — warn about departing from constitutional principles. They do not establish a covenantal framework where a nation becomes *bound to Satan* through its sins the way Cain was.

The Lord's response to the Saints' persecution was not to declare America damned but to command the Saints to "renounce war and proclaim peace" ([D&C 98:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98?lang=eng&id=p16#p16)), to seek redress through the constitutional process ([D&C 101:76–89](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101?lang=eng&id=p76-p89#p76)), and to "stand ye in holy places" ([D&C 87:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/87?lang=eng&id=p8#p8)). The Lord condemns oppression but never frames America as covenantally bound to the devil. Philpot imports a Cain/Abel covenant framework onto a Restoration context where the Lord's own instructions were more measured.

---

### Missed the Mark

**1. "42 Months" Needs Different Start/End Dates or Honest Acknowledgment**

If Philpot knows the math doesn't work (27 months, not 42), he should say so and explain what alternative calculation he's using. If he believes a different start date (perhaps the first shots at Fort Sumter, April 1861) gets closer (it doesn't — that's 48 months), he should state it. Presenting "42 months" as a straightforward fact when the obvious calculation fails by 15 months is the kind of error that erodes trust across the entire presentation. The honest move would be to say: "The 42-month period in Revelation 13:5 doesn't map cleanly to the Civil War dates I'd expect, and I don't have a satisfying answer for that."

**2. The Two-Horned Beast Transition Is Abrupt**

Philpot shifts from the first beast (sea beast = US government) to the second beast (earth beast = Wilson/Harding = two-party politics) without adequately explaining why the second beast is a *continuation* of the first rather than a separate entity. Revelation 13:11–12 presents the earth beast as distinct: it "exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him" and "causeth the earth... to worship the first beast." The text describes a subordinate relationship between two distinct beasts, not a political evolution within one nation. Philpot's reading collapses two beasts into successive phases of American political history, which flattens John's careful two-entity structure.

**3. The Mark of the Beast = Financial System Reading Lacks Specificity**

Philpot claims "It's the control of monetary policy" but doesn't develop this into a specific, verifiable thesis about *what* aspect of the financial system constitutes the mark. Is it fiat currency? The Federal Reserve? Credit systems? Taxation? The claim is broad enough to be unfalsifiable — essentially any participation in the modern economy could be called "receiving the mark." An interpretation that explains everything explains nothing.

---

### Missed Opportunities

**1. D&C 49:7 — The Consistent Standard Against Date-Setting**

> "The hour and the day no man knoweth, neither the angels in heaven, nor shall they know until he comes." — [D&C 49:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49?lang=eng&id=p7#p7)

Throughout the presentation, Philpot builds toward specific dates (2022, 2028, 2033). The Revelation 13 argument feeds into this by establishing a president-by-president timeline from Lincoln through Taft to Wilson to the present. But the Lord's own repeated standard — "no man knoweth" — should be the check on any system that claims to calculate when events will occur. Philpot could have strengthened his case by acknowledging this limitation explicitly.

**2. D&C 98:16–18 — The Lord's Alternative to Vengeance Narratives**

> "Renounce war and proclaim peace, and seek diligently to turn the hearts of the children to their fathers, and the hearts of the fathers to the children." — [D&C 98:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98?lang=eng&id=p16#p16)

Philpot's narrative about America's blood guilt is emotionally compelling but tonally one-sided. The very section he cites (D&C 98) contains the Lord's actual prescription: renounce war, proclaim peace, turn hearts. The Lord validates the Saints' suffering while redirecting their energy toward reconciliation, not toward constructing adversarial frameworks. Including this verse would have balanced the "blood oath" narrative with the Lord's own stated priority.

**3. Revelation 13:9–10 — "Here Is the Patience and the Faith of the Saints"**

> "He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints." — [Revelation 13:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/13?lang=eng&id=p10#p10)

Philpot does not pause on this verse, but it is arguably the most important verse for a Latter-day Saint reading of Revelation 13. John's counsel to the Saints living under the beast is not "identify the beast and fight it" but "endure with patient faith." The faithful response to oppressive political power is *patience*, not theological score-keeping. This verse reframes the entire chapter's application: the beast will be judged by God, and the Saints' job is to trust that judgment rather than to decode which nation is which symbol.

**4. The Industrial-Era Reading Misses the Ancient Near Eastern Context**

Philpot's reading is entirely modern — focused on 19th and 20th century America. But Revelation was written to seven specific churches in the first century ([Revelation 1:4, 11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/1?lang=eng&id=p4#p4)) facing persecution under the Roman Empire. The beast imagery would have been immediately recognized by John's original audience as referring to Rome: the seven heads as seven hills of Rome ([Rev 17:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/17?lang=eng&id=p9#p9)), the cult of emperor worship as the "mark" required for economic participation, and the "deadly wound healed" as the Nero redivivus myth. A richer reading would at minimum acknowledge the first-century context before building a last-days application.

---

## Overall Assessment

The Revelation 13 beast-kingdom argument is the most ambitious verbal segment in the entire *Signs of the Times* series. It attempts a complete verse-by-verse decoding of one of the Bible's most contested chapters, applying every symbol to specific moments in American history from 1844 to the present.

**What works:** The fundamental distinction between the dragon (Satan) and the beast (a government empowered by Satan) is textually correct. The composite-beast connection to Daniel 7 is recognized by all serious commentators. The historical persecution of the Saints is real and well-documented. The moral tension between a divinely sanctioned Constitution (D&C 98/101) and a government that violated its own principles through slavery and religious persecution is genuine. D&C 87's prophecy beginning at South Carolina is one of the most striking prophetic fulfillments in the Restoration canon.

**What doesn't work:** The 42-month calculation is factually wrong — no reasonable Civil War date pairing produces 42 months. The Daniel 2 toes-to-presidents mapping and seven-dispensation beast thesis are creative but have no textual or prophetic support. The Archduke Ferdinand claims are historically confused. The "blood oath" framework imports a Cain-like covenant theology onto a situation where the Lord's actual instructions were to "renounce war and proclaim peace" and seek constitutional redress. The two-horned beast interpretation collapses John's two-entity structure into a single-nation narrative. And the mark-of-the-beast reading is too broad to be meaningful.

**The persistent pattern continues:** Philpot's historical research is genuine — the Edmunds-Tucker Act, the 1907 declaration, the Utah statehood conditions, Hamilton's banking history — these are real events drawn from real sources. But the interpretive method again overpowers the text. Revelation 13:10 counsels "patience and faith" under the beast's power; Philpot's method instead constructs an adversarial decode-and-resist framework. The most important verse for Saints living under political oppression goes unused while speculative mappings of horns to presidents take center stage.

## Step 4: Become

### Truths to Carry

1. **The beast is a government, not the devil.** Revelation 13:1–2 makes this clear: the dragon *gives* power to the beast. They are distinct. This simple distinction changes how I read the entire chapter — it's about earthly political power animated by demonic influence, not about Satan personally.

2. **D&C 87 is a remarkable prophecy.** "Beginning at the rebellion of South Carolina" — given in 1832, fulfilled in 1860–61. The Lord knew. This deserves more attention in my study of prophetic fulfillment.

3. **The historical persecution is real.** Edmunds-Tucker, the escheating of Church property, the criminalizing of leaders, the conditions of Utah statehood — I should not minimize what the early Saints endured. Their experience genuinely resonates with "make war with the saints, and... overcome them."

### Warnings to Heed

1. **Verify math claims.** The 42-month claim fails basic arithmetic. When a presentation depends on specific date calculations, check them. A single failed calculation doesn't invalidate everything, but it does require honesty about what has and hasn't been demonstrated.

2. **Patience is the prescribed response to the beast.** Revelation 13:10 — "Here is the patience and the faith of the saints." The faithful response to oppressive power isn't decryption and resistance; it's endurance and trust in God's judgment. This is a different spirit than the adversarial framing Philpot offers.

3. **Every generation identifies the beast with its own era.** Christians under Rome saw Nero. Medieval commentators saw the Pope (or the Holy Roman Emperor). Reformation-era Protestants saw the Catholic Church. 20th-century evangelicals saw the Soviet Union or the United Nations. Philpot sees the US government. The pattern of identification is not evidence of correctness — it's evidence of how powerful the text is at resonating with whoever reads it. Humility about interpretive certainty is appropriate.

### Personal Commitments

1. **Study Revelation 13:9–10 and 14:12 together.** Both passages describe "the patience and the faith of the saints" in the context of beast-power. I want to understand what John means by the faithful response to political oppression — and how that maps to the Restoration experience.

2. **Cross-reference D&C 87 with D&C 130:12–13.** Joseph Smith prophesied the Civil War in both places. Studying them together may reveal more about how the Lord views the intersection of war, slavery, and the Saints' experience.

3. **Read the 1907 Church Declaration in its original context.** Philpot's verbal reading of the conditional language was compelling. I want to read the full text in the General Conference Report of 1907 and understand what the Church was asserting — and what it was reserving.
