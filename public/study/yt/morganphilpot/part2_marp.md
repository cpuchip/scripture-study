# Section E
## Systemic Changes & 2 Esdras
### The Eagle Vision

*~0:00–16:00*

---

## Systemic Changes After Statehood

After the conquest of the priesthood kingdom, systemic changes entrenched the new power structure:

- **1910** — Jekyll Island meeting → Federal Reserve Act (1913)
- **16th Amendment** (1913) — Federal income tax
- **17th Amendment** (1913) — Direct election of senators, removing state-level check on federal power

The financial architecture of the beast consolidated.

## The Apocrypha

> "There are many things contained therein that are true… There are many things contained therein that are not true… Therefore, whoso readeth it, let him understand, for the Spirit manifesteth truth; And whoso is enlightened by the Spirit shall obtain benefit therefrom." — D&C 91:1–5

Some good, some bad — use the Spirit.

## 2 Esdras 11 — The Eagle Vision

> "Then saw I a dream, and, behold, there came up from the sea an eagle, which had twelve feathered wings, and three heads."

The eagle = a world power. The feathered wings = rulers who come one after another. The three heads = three centers of power.

Philpot maps this to the United States.

<!--
Original slides 190–210
~8:30–9:30
-->

---

## The Feathers = Presidents

The twelve feathers on the right side = twelve early leaders. The eight smaller feathers = later presidents. The three heads = government + two political parties.

Six "contrary feathers" = tail feathers (specific presidents who disrupt the sequence).

<!--
Original slides ~205–208

## Current Events — Biden & Continuity

The "center head that dies in bed" — mapped to current political transition.

Shadow government discussion: Cheney, Secret Service hearing, helicopter crash, Joint Chiefs January 12, 2021 letter.

# Section F
## The Year-by-Year Timeline
### Book of Mormon → Modern Parallels

*~21:00–54:00 — Slides + extensive verbal development*

---

## The Framework

The year-by-year mapping begins from the Nephite 92nd year = Year 2000 (the dedication of the Palmyra Temple).

Each Nephite year maps to a modern year. The parallels track events in 3 Nephi against events in the United States and the Church.

<!--
~21:00–30:00
-->

---

## Joseph F. Smith = Modern Alma

The year-by-year framework begins with Joseph F. Smith as a type of Alma — a leader who witnessed the period of relative peace before the Gadianton infiltration.

<!--
Original slide ~218

---

## Howard W. Hunter = Samuel the Lamanite

- First prophet not of "covenant birth" (born outside Utah)
- Served **nine months** as prophet
- Coined the phrase "**calamities foretold**"
- Hinckley placed Hunter's exact quote in the **Family Proclamation**

> "I invite all members of the Church to live with ever more attention to the life and example of the Lord Jesus Christ."
> — Howard W. Hunter

<!--

~35:00–37:00. Extensive verbal development — much more than the slide.

---

## Year 92 / Year 2000 — The Palmyra Sign

**April 5–6, 2000** — Palmyra Temple Dedication

- Thursday, April 6, 2000 = 1 Nisan 5760 (first day of Hebrew year)
- Also the 7th day of Passover — when tradition says God parted the Red Sea
- Planetary alignment visible from Palmyra at sunset April 5

The Hebrew Mazzaroth (zodiac) and the planetary positions on this date form part of the "signs in the heavens."

<!--

## Psalms 19 — The Heavens Declare

> "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard." — Psalm 19:1–3

> "Which is as a **bridegroom coming out of his chamber**, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race." — Psalm 19:5

<!--
Original slide 228
-->

---

## Appointed Times — mō·w·'ă·ḏîm

> "Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven… and let them be for **signs**, and for **seasons**" — Genesis 1:14

The Hebrew word translated "seasons" is **mō·w·'ă·ḏîm** — literally "appointed times."

The same word appears in Leviticus 23: "These are the **feasts** [mō·w·'ă·ḏê] of the Lord… which ye shall proclaim at their **appointed times** [bə·mō·w·'ă·ḏām]."

The heavenly bodies mark God's calendar.

## Year 95 / Year 2004 — The People Forget

> "The people began to **forget** those signs and wonders which they had heard, and began to be less and less astonished at a sign or a wonder from heaven, insomuch that they began to be **hard in their hearts**, and blind in their minds." — 3 Nephi 2:1

> "Satan did go about, leading away the hearts of the people, tempting them and causing them that they should do great wickedness in the land." — 3 Nephi 2:3

<!--

---

## 9/11 = Revelation 18

> "Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for **in one hour** is thy judgment come." — Revelation 18:10

> "And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more." — Revelation 18:11

**8:46 AM** — Flight 11, North Tower
**9:03 AM** — Flight 175, South Tower
**9:37 AM** — Flight 77, Pentagon

Shipmasters converge: The harbor evacuation of lower Manhattan — "every kind of small vessel in the port responded."

<!--

## The Verbal Path: Babel → Isaiah 9–10 → Rev 18

The slides derive "double" from Greek *diplōsate/dipla* → two towers (etymological).

The verbal delivery takes a different, richer path:
1. **Babel** — pride of building upward
2. **Isaiah 9:10** — "The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones"
3. **Revelation 18** — the fall of the great city

The verbal reasoning is historically richer than the slide's Greek word study.

<!--
Verbal path differs from slide path — documented in transcript review
~49:00–52:00

## Isaiah 9–10: The Harbinger Pattern

> "The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones; the sycomores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars." — Isaiah 9:10

**Tom Daschle**, September 12, 2001 — quoted Isaiah 9:10 on the Senate floor as a defiant pledge to rebuild.

The pattern continues:
- **Sycamore tree** at Ground Zero literally destroyed
- **Washington's oath** at the inauguration site
- **Obama** — "rebuild"
- **Trump** — "build back better"

## 3 Nephi 2:8 — The Reckoning Change

> "Now the Nephites began to reckon their time from this period when the sign was given, or from the coming of Christ." — 3 Nephi 2:8

Hinckley declared 2000 the new millennium — while it was actually the last year of the old. A reckoning change that parallels the Nephite shift.

## Hinckley's Gadianton Comparison

> "The Book of Mormon speaks of the **Gadianton robbers**, a vicious, oath-bound, and secret organization bent on evil and destruction. In their day they did all in their power… to bring down the Church, to woo the people with sophistry, and to take control of the society. **We see the same thing in the present situation.**"
> — President Hinckley, October 2001

"What did 9/11 have to do with taking down the church?" The Gadianton framework is broader than terrorism.

<!--
Original slide 195
~52:00–54:00

## Hearts Turned & Temple Work Shift

The transition from wheat to grape harvest involves a shift in temple ordinances:

- **D&C 13** — "the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness"
- **D&C 128:24** — "a book containing the records of our dead"

The end of the wheat harvest = the end of the Aaronic-style offering. The robe change in the temple ceremony may signal this transition.

## McCarthy Files = Gadianton Introduction

**McCarthy files unsealed in 2020** — "McCarthy was right, communists in State Department."

In the year-by-year framework, this parallels the introduction of Gadianton robbers into Nephite society — the moment the conspiracy became visible.

# Section G
## Lachoneus & the Modern Parallel
### The Book of Mormon War Chapters Applied

*~58:00–1:11:00*

---

## Lachoneus = Trump

A detailed verse-by-verse parallel:

| 3 Nephi | Modern Parallel |
|---------|----------------|
| Nationalist leader | Nationalist-isolationist policies |
| Gathers people to center of land | "Gather in center of land" |
| Builds up army | Military/DHS buildup |
| 5-year siege mentality | COVID era as siege |
| Highways and infrastructure | AI superhighway |

The parallel extends across multiple chapters of 3 Nephi.

<!--
Original slides ~256–260 + extensive verbal
~58:00–62:00

## Gidgiddoni — The Military Strategist

> "Now the people said unto Gidgiddoni: Pray unto the Lord, and let us go up upon the mountains and into the wilderness, that we may fall upon the robbers and destroy them in their own lands. But Gidgiddoni saith unto them: The Lord forbid" — 3 Nephi 3:20–21

"A strategist" — the military leader who executes the defense.

*(Note: Musk is NOT named in the verbal delivery — identification appears slide-only or audience inference)*

<!--
Original slide ~262
~61:00
-->

---

## DHS/ICE — The Internal Army

Lachoneus building an army = the DHS/ICE buildup under Hegseth.

The defense is being assembled — not to go on offense, but to fortify from within.

## Lachoneus 2 — Assassination Prediction

In the Book of Mormon, the second Lachoneus is assassinated.

Philpot makes a specific, testable prediction based on rabbinic hermeneutic: a future leader in this Lachoneus role will be murdered.

**This is the most explicitly speculative claim in the series.**

<!--

## BYU & Universities as "Temples of Baal"

> "Send kids through the fire" — a reference to child sacrifice.

Philpot argues that universities, including BYU, function as modern temples of Baal: parents sacrifice their children's faith and resources for credentials.

<!--

~65:00–66:00

## Church SEC Fine & Corporate Destruction

- **1934 Securities Exchange Act** compliance
- **$5M fine** — extortion mechanism
- Australia/Canada auditing Church finances
- Corporate fiction as vulnerability

The institutional Church, as a legal corporation, is subject to the beast's regulatory power.
