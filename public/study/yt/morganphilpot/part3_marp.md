# Section H
## Corporate Fiction & Current Events

*~0:00–12:00*

---

## Corporate Fiction as Ontological Problem

The US government owns all corporate property by legal structure. Nationalization is trivially easy.

**Corporate personhood** is an ontological fiction — corporations are not persons, but the legal system treats them as such. This makes every corporation, including the Church's corporate entities, subject to the beast's regulatory power.

## The Prosecution Ladder

> "If you're going after a terrorist cell, who do you prosecute first?"

Bolton, Comey indictments — you start at the bottom and work up. The legal machinery currently in operation follows this pattern.

## The Hinge Point — Wheat to Grape

> "You've got a doctor ruling over the Church during a pandemic at a hinge point. And I got to get back to the grape harvest. The hinge point is the change from the harvest of the wheat to the grape harvest."

The "hinge point" is a **harvest transition** — not the D&C 112/Seventh Seal calculation from the slides, but a shift in *what kind of harvest* God is conducting.

The wheat gathering is ending. The grape judgment is beginning.

<!--
Verbal-only — no original slide
~12:00
Note: The slides use "hinge point" for a different, more technical argument about D&C 112 and the Seventh Seal calculation. The verbal delivery reframes it as an agricultural/typological transition.

# Section I
## Future Projections & Preparation

*~12:00–35:00*

---

## Nelson's Warnings — Finally Verbal

> "The Lord is urging me to tell you to prepare for the second coming."

An audience member quotes Nelson's last talk. Philpot responds:

> "People like me hear that and I'm like, I got to build a bunker. I got to get off grid. And then I come out and I meet people like you and I'm like, oh, there's other people like me."

<!--
Verbal-only — no original slide (Phase 2 slide content finally gets verbal treatment — but in Part III, not Part I)
~12:00–13:00
-->

---

## Oaks' First Talk — An Analysis

Philpot analyzes President Oaks' first general conference talk:

- **No temples announced** — a notable departure
- **Family Proclamation** doubled down
- **John Taylor polygamy letter** referenced
- **William Clayton journals** — the same source as the Council of Fifty
- **D&C 132** in Come Follow Me curriculum

The prophetic emphasis has shifted.

## The 2028 Deadline

> "Let's say the Lord is coming to Adam in 2033 just like he came to the Nephites in Bountiful in the 34th year. So if again theoretical exercise, I got to be in Missouri in 2033. **When should I be prepared to go?**"

"Before 2028."

- 2028 election as the critical threshold
- Travel restrictions may follow
- Massive secession crisis predicted for ~2030

## Storm vs. Tempest — Webster 1828

> "In the thirty and fourth year, in the first month, on the fourth day of the month, there arose a great **storm**, such an one as never had been known" — 3 Nephi 8:5

> "The thunderings, and the lightnings, and the **storm**, and the **tempest**, and the quakings of the earth" — 3 Nephi 8:19

Mormon uses *both* words deliberately:
- **Storm** (1828) = political/military upheaval
- **Tempest** (1828) = natural catastrophe

The destruction of 3 Nephi 8 includes both political AND natural components.

## Creation Day 4 — The Sun Created

On the fourth day of creation, God made the sun, moon, and stars.

Christ must die before the end of "day 4" — the fourth thousandth year. The beast rises from the sea on "day 5."

> "In the first month, on the **fourth day** of the month" — 3 Nephi 8:5

The fourth day is the critical day.

---

## Destruction Mechanisms — Speculation

How might 3 Nephi 8's destruction manifest in our day?

- Polar shift
- Super volcano
- Nuclear war

These are speculative possibilities — the text describes geographic upheaval, three hours of destruction, then three days of darkness.

<!--
Verbal-only — no original slide
~35:00. Most speculative content in the entire presentation.

# Section J
## Harvest, Invitation & New Jerusalem

*~35:00–50:00*

---

## The Grape Harvest — Revelation 14

> "And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, **Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth**; for her grapes are fully ripe." — Revelation 14:17–18

"Who warned of the darker signs of the times? President Nelson. And you'd see that it's time to be like the Nephites. Remember who you are. Remember where you're supposed to be. And get ready."

<!--

---

## The Wedding at Cana

> "And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there" — John 2:1

"Six barrels of wine" — the first miracle, at a wedding feast, on the third day.

The wedding imagery connects back to the bridegroom motif (Matthew 25, Revelation 19:7) that opened Part I.

<!--

## Temple Ceremony Changes as Prophetic Signs

Recent changes to the temple ceremony:
- **Veil removed**
- **Robes switched**
- **Ceremony shortened**

Philpot reads these as prophetic signals — the ordinances themselves are testifying of a transition between harvests.

<!--
Verbal-only — no original slide
~42:27
-->

---

## An Invitation

> "I invite all of you to be crazy with me."

A moment of personal vulnerability — the invitation is not to believe every claim, but to take the scriptures seriously enough to "liken them unto us in a very extreme way."

<!--
Verbal-only — no original slide
~44:00

---

## Abinadi & the Ten Commandments

> "And now Abinadi said unto them: Are you priests, and pretend to teach this people, and to understand the spirit of prophesying, and yet desire to know of me what these things mean? I say unto you, wo be unto you for perverting the ways of the Lord! For if ye understand these things ye have not taught them" — Mosiah 12:25–26

"We teach our children in our public schools to break all ten commandments."

A provocative claim about the disconnect between covenant standards and public education.

<!--

~46:00–49:00

## New Jerusalem — Ether 13

> "Behold, Ether saw the days of Christ, and he spake concerning a **New Jerusalem** upon this land. And he spake also concerning the house of Israel, and the **Jerusalem from whence Lehi should come** — after it should be destroyed it should be built up again, a holy city" — Ether 13:4–5

> "There shall be a **new heaven and a new earth**; and they shall be like unto the old save the old have passed away" — Ether 13:9

The seed of Joseph Smith — the remnant that will build the New Jerusalem.

## "Third vs. Totality"

A framework for reading Revelation's proportional language:

The Nephites received a **"third"** — one-third of their land destroyed, three hours of catastrophe, three days of darkness.

We may receive the **totality** — what was partial for the Nephites becomes complete for the last generation.

<!--

# Section K
## Q&A Highlights

*~50:00–1:00:00*

---

## Corporate Church in the Millennium?

> "Do you really think they're going to reinitiate the corporation of the first presidency in the millennium?"

The corporate structure serves temporal purposes. In the millennial kingdom, the organizational model changes.

<!--

~55:11–57:00

---

## 2,500 at Bountiful

> "And it came to pass that there were about **two thousand and five hundred souls**" — 3 Nephi 17:25

2,500 = half of 5,000 = half of 10 virgins (in a proportional reading).

Bountiful as a Passover/Sukkot gathering place — "that's where they go for conference."

<!--

## Zarahemla = Salt Lake City?

> "And it came to pass… that there was a great and terrible destruction in the land southward. But behold, there was a more great and terrible destruction in the land northward… the great city **Zarahemla** did take fire." — 3 Nephi 8:8–10

**Zarahemla** — from Hebrew **hemlah** (חֶמְלָה) = salt.

The Dead Sea is called the "Salt Sea." Zarahemla = "city of salt."

**"What's the modern Zarahemla?"** → Salt Lake City.

<!--
Verbal-only — no original slide (Q&A)
~57:54. Creative Hebrew word study — parallel to the slide-only Kokaubeam work, but this one is verbal.

---

## COVID Temple Closure

> "What happened to people who fled to the temples on March 26, 2020? They were closed. We had a worldwide pandemic. So if you fled to the temple during the worldwide pandemic, you met closed doors and nobody was there."

A pragmatic observation — three sentences, no elaborate theological framing.

*(Note: The slides build a detailed D&C 112 / Seventh Seal argument around COVID temple closures. The verbal delivery is simply this brief, practical point.)*

| **Grapes** | Beginning — the judgment harvest | Wrath phase, political upheaval |
| **Olives** | Future — the anointing | Adam-ondi-Ahman, Christ crowned King |

> "Wherefore, stand ye in holy places, and be not moved, until the day of the Lord come." — D&C 87:8
