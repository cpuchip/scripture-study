# Transcript Review Plan

A systematic re-review of all three video transcripts against the nine completed phase evaluations, ensuring Philpot's *verbal* arguments — not just his slides — are faithfully captured.

> *"But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief."* — [1 Thessalonians 5:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-thes/5?lang=eng&id=p4#p4)

---

## Why This Review

The nine phase evaluations were written primarily from the **slides** ([slides.md](../../../yt/morganphilpot/slides.md)) with supporting transcript reads. But slides are scaffolding — the real argument lives in what Philpot *says*. A presenter of his caliber will:

- Explain nuances that aren't on the slide
- Tell stories and anecdotes that illustrate his points
- Make verbal connections between scriptures that the slides only list
- Respond to the audience's energy and add off-script material
- State his strongest claims in speech, not on a bullet point

This review ensures we didn't miss anything that changes an evaluation — "In Line" arguments we didn't catch, "Out of Line" claims we overlooked, or nuances that shift something from one category to another.

## Method

For each review pass:

1. **Load** the transcript section (by timestamp range from study_plans.md)
2. **Load** the corresponding phase evaluation document
3. **Read** the transcript carefully, noting:
   - Verbal arguments not present on slides
   - Stories, anecdotes, or personal experiences
   - Scripture citations spoken but not on slides
   - Claims stated more forcefully (or more carefully) than the slide suggests
   - Audience interaction or off-script moments
   - Tone and emphasis that changes the meaning
4. **Compare** against the evaluation: Did we capture this? Did we evaluate it fairly?
5. **Document** findings in the "Findings" section below
6. **Update** the phase evaluation if warranted (add new sections, adjust ratings, note missed content)

## Review Schedule

### Part I Transcript — Phases 1–5

Part I covers the most ground: five full phases in 1:24. The transcript is the longest (~68 KB) and the slide density is highest here.

#### Pass 1: Phase 1 — Foundation & Harvest Framework
- **Transcript:** Part I ~0:00–19:00
- **Slides:** 2–38
- **Evaluation:** [01_foundation.md](01_foundation.md)
- **Review focus:** The harvest typology verbal explanation — does Philpot elaborate on the creation-day / holy-week / 7000-year / 7-seal parallel in ways the slides don't capture? Any personal testimony or anecdotes about how he arrived at this framework?

#### Pass 2: Phase 2 — Signs & Prophetic Warnings
- **Transcript:** Part I ~19:00–34:00
- **Slides:** 40–92
- **Evaluation:** [02_signs_and_warnings.md](02_signs_and_warnings.md)
- **Review focus:** This is a dense slide section (52 slides in 15 minutes). The verbal delivery likely moves fast. Watch for: Nelson quote context, the "likening" hermeneutic argument, 1 Nephi 14 verbal explanation, any D&C 121:26-32 elaboration that isn't on the slides.

#### Pass 3: Phase 3 — Grand Apocalyptic Vision
- **Transcript:** Part I ~34:00–42:00
- **Slides:** 93–120
- **Evaluation:** [03_apocalyptic_vision.md](03_apocalyptic_vision.md)
- **Review focus:** The Deuteronomy 29–30 covenant framework, Constitution as patriarchal instrument, and the 1 Nephi 13 → 3 Nephi 21 Gentile thread. Only 8 minutes for 27 slides — he may be reading scripture aloud rather than adding commentary. Or he may pack verbal arguments between slides.

#### Pass 4: Phase 4 — Revelation 12
- **Transcript:** Part I ~42:00–1:00:00
- **Slides:** 121–148
- **Evaluation:** [04_revelation_12.md](04_revelation_12.md)
- **Review focus:** The most historically dense section. The Council of Fifty = "man child" argument, the William Clayton journal references, the jubilee math (50+100+25=175). Philpot likely explains the historical reasoning verbally in ways the slides can't. This is the longest single-phase segment in Part I (18 minutes).

#### Pass 5: Phase 5 — Ezekiel's Eagle
- **Transcript:** Part I ~1:00:00–1:24:00
- **Slides:** 149–186
- **Evaluation:** [05_ezekiels_eagle.md](05_ezekiels_eagle.md)
- **Review focus:** The Ezekiel 17 riddle, Hebrew word study (kə·nā·'an), Edmunds-Tucker history, and the "rebellious house" argument. Nearly 24 minutes — the longest Part I segment. Philpot may narrate historical events with more detail than the slides show. Also the transition into 2 Esdras that sets up Phase 6.

---

### Part II Transcript — Phases 6–8a

Part II covers three phases in 1:11. The transcript is ~54 KB.

#### Pass 6: Phase 6 — Esdras, Daniel & Appointed Times
- **Transcript:** Part II ~0:00–30:00
- **Slides:** 187–228
- **Evaluation:** [06_esdras_and_appointed_times.md](06_esdras_and_appointed_times.md)
- **Review focus:** D&C 91 framing of Apocrypha, the Ezra's Eagle feather-to-president mapping (verbal specifics), the Hebrew word study (mō·w·'ă·ḏîm), and the Palmyra Temple astronomical claims. Half of Part II — this is where Philpot likely takes the most time explaining the controversial Esdras material.

#### Pass 7: Phase 7 — The Type & Sign
- **Transcript:** Part II ~30:00–55:00
- **Slides:** 229–268
- **Evaluation:** [07_type_and_sign.md](07_type_and_sign.md)
- **Review focus:** The year-by-year BoM-modern parallels, the 9/11 = Revelation 18 argument, and the pharmakeia word study. This is the heart of the "two-timeline" interpretive claim. Philpot's verbal explanations of the year-by-year mapping will be more detailed than the slide bullets. 25 minutes for 39 slides.

#### Pass 8: Phase 8a — Isaiah's Harbinger (Part II portion)
- **Transcript:** Part II ~55:00–1:11:00
- **Slides:** 269–310 (approx)
- **Evaluation:** [08_harbinger_and_hinge.md](08_harbinger_and_hinge.md)
- **Review focus:** Isaiah 9–10 harbinger pattern, the Palmyra/Jericho connection, and the beginning of the COVID hinge-point argument. Part II ends mid-Phase 8 — note where the break falls.

---

### Part III Transcript — Phases 8b–9

Part III covers the end of Phase 8 and all of Phase 9 in 1:00. The transcript is ~46 KB.

#### Pass 9: Phase 8b — The Hinge Point & Types of Judah (Part III portion)
- **Transcript:** Part III ~0:00–25:00
- **Slides:** 310–355 (approx)
- **Evaluation:** [08_harbinger_and_hinge.md](08_harbinger_and_hinge.md)
- **Review focus:** COVID timeline (day-by-day March 2020), D&C 112:24-25 "upon my house" argument, Nelson "hinge point" quote, the half-hour-of-silence calculation (20.8 years), and the Judah–Utah governor mapping. The COVID section is likely the most emotionally charged verbal delivery — watch for personal reflections and audience response.

#### Pass 10: Phase 9 — The Two Great Lights & Culmination
- **Transcript:** Part III ~25:00–1:00:00
- **Slides:** 356–369 + extended
- **Evaluation:** [09_culmination.md](09_culmination.md)
- **Review focus:** Only 13 slides for 35 minutes — Philpot's verbal delivery dominates here. The Kokaubeam word study, future projections (2025–2033), Revelation 14 harvest, Adam-ondi-Ahman, Joseph Smith typology, and his closing testimony. This is where the date-setting claims are likely stated most explicitly and where his personal conviction comes through strongest.

## Findings

*To be populated during review passes.*

### Pass 1: Phase 1 — Foundation
- **Status:** Complete
- **Transcript lines read:** 1–150 (Part I, ~0:00–28:30)
- **New content found:**
  1. **Temple sealing as Second Coming type** (~1:59–8:24): Philpot opens with ~19 minutes of verbal-only argument (no slides) comparing modern Saints missing the Second Coming testimony in the sealing to ancient Jews missing the messianic testimony of their temple. Bridegroom motif: [Matthew 25:1–13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/25?lang=eng&id=p1-p13#p1), [Revelation 19:7–9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/19?lang=eng&id=p7-p9#p7), [D&C 33:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/33?lang=eng&id=p17#p17). Connects to [1 Nephi 1:19–20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p19-p20#p19) — Lehi told Jews their temple testified of Messiah and they wanted to kill him.
  2. **D&C 13 / D&C 128:24** (~4:00–8:00): Sons of Levi offering in righteousness. When fulfilled? What happens to Aaronic Priesthood when it is?
  3. **3 Nephi 7→8 “four days” argument** (~11:26–13:00): Only 4 days between end of 3 Nephi 7 and destruction of 3 Nephi 8:5. People were arguing about whether Christ was coming. “Which one are we?”
  4. **Nelson/Oaks Jewish calendar connections** (~15:00–16:00): Three verified claims — Nelson sustained Passover weekend 2018 (March 31); Nelson died during Days of Awe (Sept 27, 2025); Oaks sustained on Shemini Atzeret (Oct 14, 2025).
  5. **Philpot’s disclaimer** (~14:30): “Everything I do is not intended to convince you I’m right... it’s intended to try to stimulate your mind.”
- **Evaluation changes made:** Added items 8–11 to Key Claims; added 7 verbal-only scripture references; added items 8–9 to In Line evaluation; updated cite count and datestamp.

### Pass 2: Phase 2 — Signs & Warnings
- **Status:** Complete
- **Transcript lines read:** Part I lines 1–150 (full, reusing Pass 1 read); Part III lines 1–30 (full 38-line transcript for Nelson/2033 content); Part II searched for Phase 2 keywords (none found)
- **New content found:**
  1. **Phase 2 is the most slide-dependent phase.** Of 8 Key Claims on slides 40–92, only the "likening" hermeneutic and Nelson's warnings are verbally developed. The remaining six (1 Nephi 14, D&C 88, JST Matthew 1, Woman at the Well, Walk to Emmaus, D&C 121) exist only on slides with no verbal elaboration in any of the three transcripts.
  2. **Nelson's warnings appear in Part III, not Part I.** Verbal treatment (~12:00–13:15) includes audience member quoting Nelson's last talk ("The Lord is urging me to tell you to prepare"), Philpot's personal reaction ("I got to build a bunker"), and at ~38:19: "Who warned of the darker signs of the times? President Nelson."
  3. **Date calculation shifts from ~2034 to 2033.** Slides derive ~2034 from John 4:40 + 2 Peter 3:8. Verbal derives 2033 from BoM 34th year: "the Lord is coming to Adam in 2033 just like he came to the Nephites in Bountiful in the 34th year." Different reasoning — doesn't require "1 day = 1,000 years" formula.
  4. **Preparation urgency argument** (Part III ~25:00–32:00): Extended practical argument about secession crisis, travel restrictions, and being prepared before 2028 election. Creates urgency without explicit date-setting.
  5. **Corporate destruction argument** (Part III ~0:05–12:00): Verbal-only argument about how church's corporate structure could be dissolved by government during national crisis.
  6. **Two "Out of Line" items (Woman at the Well, Walk to Emmaus) are slide-only.** Philpot never verbally defends them — they exist as visual backdrop only.
  7. **Previous timestamp references were fabricated.** "Front-row seats" and "two churches" quotes linked to Part I ~5:00–7:00 are not in any transcript. Replaced with 6 verified transcript quotes.
- **Evaluation changes made:** Added Transcript Review Notes section; added Key Claims 9–11; added 3 verbal-only scripture references; added "Out of Line" note about slide-only status; replaced 3 fabricated timestamp references with 6 verified quotes; added Part III to Source Material table; updated datestamp.

### Pass 3: Phase 3 — Apocalyptic Vision
- **Status:** Complete
- **Transcript lines read:** Part I (full, reusing Passes 1-2); searched all three transcripts for Phase 3 keywords (Deuteronomy, Constitution, patriarchal, Tabernacles, Amos, Daniel, Columbus, Pilgrim, 1620, Rosh Hashanah, Colossians, Nephi 13)
- **New content found:**
  1. **Phase 3 continues the slide-dependent pattern.** None of the 10 Key Claims are verbally presented as standalone Phase 3 content. The "Grand Apocalyptic Vision" chain, Deuteronomy covenant pattern, 1620/Pilgrims, Constitution-as-patriarchal reading, Jewish calendar alignments, and Nephi-to-John handoff all exist only on slides.
  2. **Key difference from Phase 2:** Phase 3's building blocks (Daniel 2, D&C 98/101, founding fathers) ARE verbally referenced — but woven into the Revelation 12 / beast kingdoms narrative of Phases 4–5, not as standalone Phase 3 discussion. Audience hears these ideas as part of a larger historical narrative, not as theological architecture.
  3. **Gold plates 1827 date acknowledged verbally** (Part I ~29:00) in the Revelation 12 sign-of-the-woman context, but without the Rosh Hashanah feast-day label from the slides.
  4. **Timestamp references were descriptive, not actual quotes.** Updated 3 references to accurately note slide-only sourcing.
- **Evaluation changes made:** Added Transcript Review Notes section with verbal-vs-slide mapping table; updated timestamp references with accuracy note; added transcript review datestamp.

### Pass 4: Phase 4 — Revelation 12
- **Status:** Complete
- **Transcript lines read:** Part I lines 28–50 (reusing full Part I read from Passes 1–3; timestamps ~28:30–1:23:52 covering all Phase 4 and Phase 5 verbal content)
- **New content found:**
  1. **Phase 4 is the best-captured phase in the series.** Unlike Phases 2–3, all 10 Key Claims plus the Karl Marx transcript-only item are verbally developed AND already evaluated. The evaluation's Deep Reading Checklist correctly identified "28:00–40:00" as the primary transcript range. No category changes needed (In Line, Nuanced, Out of Line ratings all hold up against the verbal delivery).
  2. **Review plan timestamp was wrong.** The plan listed Phase 4 at ~42:00–1:00:00, but the actual verbal Phase 4 content runs ~28:30–42:00 in Part I. Content after ~42:00 (Daniel 2 toes-to-presidents, Hamilton, Civil War, Edmunds-Tucker) belongs to Phase 5. The evaluation was already correct; the review plan was off.
  3. **Three verbal-only items not in original evaluation (minor):** (a) Michael/Adam premortal distinction ("Michael is to our spirits what Adam is to our bodies" ~34:39) — creative but speculative; (b) explicit "heavenly vs. earthly pageant = different timelines" framing that justifies applying Rev 12 imagery on jubilee timescale rather than literal 3.5 years; (c) Joseph's territorial vision (Arizona, Utah, Idaho as full intended territory, compared to Israelites settling for partial conquest).
  4. **Large Phase 4→5 bleed zone (~42:00–53:46).** The verbal delivery passes seamlessly from Revelation 12 into beast kingdoms, Daniel 2 ten toes, Cain/stone/government, Hamilton/banking, South+Mormons as commodity economies, "blood oath between devil and United States," seven heads = seven dispensational beasts, beast = government not devil. These items should be evaluated under Phase 5, not Phase 4.
  5. **No fabricated quotes found.** Unlike Passes 2–3, all transcript references in the Phase 4 evaluation check out. The evaluation was clearly written with closer transcript access.
- **Evaluation changes made:** Added Transcript Review Notes section with verbal-vs-slide mapping table, 3 verbal-only items, timestamp correction, and Phase 4→5 bleed zone inventory for Phase 5 review.

### Pass 5: Phase 5 — Ezekiel's Eagle
- **Status:** Complete
- **Transcript lines read:** Part I lines 28–50 (reusing full Part I read; Phase 5 verbal content ~42:00–1:24:00); grep searches across all three transcripts for Ezekiel-specific terms
- **New content found:**
  1. **The Ezekiel 17 riddle is ENTIRELY slide-only.** Zero mentions of Ezekiel, Commerce (IL), traffick, divers colours, highest branch, Cainan, rebellious house, or Cumming in any transcript. The Hebrew word studies, the Commerce→Canaan connection, and the "rebellious house" framework were never verbally presented. This is the LARGEST slide-vs-verbal gap in the series.
  2. **The verbal Phase 5 is actually a comprehensive Revelation 13 beast-kingdom identification of the United States** — running verse-by-verse through Rev 13:1–18 with specific historical mappings: beast=US government (not devil), Civil War=deadly wound healed, 42 months claim (appears mathematically wrong), seven heads=seven dispensational beasts, 10 horns=10 post-Lincoln presidents to Taft, two-horned beast=Wilson/Harding (Republican/Democrat), nuclear weapons="fire from heaven," intelligence community=image of beast, financial system=mark of beast. **None of this is evaluated in the current Phase 5 document.**
  3. **The evaluation's Ezekiel 17 analysis remains valid as SLIDE criticism** — eisegesis of self-interpreting text, Hebrew word mismatches, OD1 mischaracterization. But the audience never heard this argument.
  4. **18 verbal-only items documented** in Transcript Review Notes, including: Daniel 2 toes-to-presidents mapping, Cain/Abel temple symbolism, Hamilton/central banking narrative, "twin relics of barbarism" (1856), "blood oath" concept, Joseph Smith independence mandate, Marie Antoinette temple work aside.
  5. **Overlap between verbal and slides limited to:** Edmunds-Tucker criminalizing brethren, Utah statehood equal-footing clause violation, birthright forfeiture (land, priesthood, religious freedom, posterity). These are correctly evaluated.
  6. **42-months claim appears mathematically incorrect.** Philpot says "from the emancipation proclamation to the surrender of Lee was 42 months" — Emancipation Proclamation Jan 1, 1863 to Lee's surrender April 9, 1865 ≈ 27 months, not 42. Unless a different start date is intended.
- **Evaluation changes made:** Added comprehensive Transcript Review Notes section with verbal-vs-slide mapping table, 18 verbal-only Revelation 13 items documented, assessment of the slide/verbal gap, and note on evaluation validity.

### Pass 6: Phase 6 — Esdras & Appointed Times
- **Status:** Complete
- **Transcript lines read:** Part II full transcript (lines 1–end, ~0:00–1:11:00); verbal Phase 6 content runs ~0:00–49:00 with year-by-year mapping extending to ~65:00+
- **New content found:**
  1. **Phase 6 is well-captured relative to the series.** Unlike Phases 2–3 and 5, most Key Claims are both on slides AND verbally developed. The evaluation's categorizations (In Line, Nuanced, Out of Line) all hold up against the verbal delivery.
  2. **7 substantial verbal-only arguments not in the evaluation:** (a) Continuity of government/shadow government discussion (~14:00–16:00); (b) Federal Reserve/Jekyll Island/16th–17th Amendments (~2:59–5:00); (c) Detailed Lachoneus=Trump verse-by-verse parallel (~58:00–62:00); (d) Lachoneus 2 assassination prediction (~65:00) — specific testable claim; (e) BYU/universities as "temples of Baal" (~65:00); (f) Church SEC fine/corporate destruction/felony argument (~67:00); (g) Hearts turned/temple work shift/robe change (~54:11).
  3. **Howard W. Hunter = Samuel the Lamanite (Key Claim 12) is listed but never directly evaluated in Step 3.** The verbal delivery is compelling: first non-covenant-birth prophet, nine months, coined "calamities foretold," Hinckley placed Hunter's exact quote in the Family Proclamation. Deserves assessment.
  4. **The mō·w·'ă·ḏîm Hebrew word study is concept-verbal but terminology-slide.** The argument that heavenly bodies mark appointed times is verbally made, but the specific Hebrew terms and verse-by-verse linguistics are on slides, not spoken.
  5. **The year-by-year BoM timeline is FAR more detailed verbally than the evaluation captures.** The evaluation correctly critiques the methodology as unfalsifiable (Out of Line #4) but doesn't engage the specific parallels the audience heard: McCarthy=Gadianton introduction (with unsealed files), Watergate=sole management, COVID=siege, AI highways, DHS buildup, 2028 election prediction.
  6. **Gap is SCOPE not ACCURACY.** The evaluation's existing analysis is correct; it just covers a subset of what Philpot actually said.
- **Evaluation changes made:** Added comprehensive Transcript Review Notes section with verbal-vs-slide mapping table, 7 verbal-only items documented, assessment of Hunter/Samuel gap, and scope-vs-accuracy analysis.

### Pass 7: Phase 7 — Type & Sign
- **Status:** Complete
- **Transcript lines read:** Part II full (reusing Pass 6 read); Part III full (lines 1–end, ~0:00–1:00:00); grep searches across all three transcripts for pharmakeia-related terms
- **New content found:**
  1. **The pharmakeia word study (4 Key Claims) is ENTIRELY slide-only.** Zero transcript hits for φαρμακεία, pharmaceutical, pharmacy, "conspiring men," "wizards that peep and mutter," or Strong's 5331. The evaluation's In Line #2-3 are valid textual analysis, but the audience never heard this argument. Mirrors Phase 5's Ezekiel 17 pattern.
  2. **The 9/11 = Rev 18 "double" argument follows a DIFFERENT verbal path than the slide.** Slides: Greek diplōsate/dipla → two towers (etymological). Verbal: Babel pride → Isaiah 9–10 northern kingdom tower → John "doubles" pattern in Rev 18 (narrative/typological). The verbal reasoning is historically richer. The evaluation's Missed the Mark #4 (diplōsate critique) is valid for slides but irrelevant to what audience heard.
  3. **3 Nephi 2:8 "reckoning change" = Y2K millennial shift is verbal but NOT in the evaluation.** Philpot argues at ~52:00 that Hinckley declared 2000 the new millennium while it was actually the last year of the old — matching 3 Nephi 2:8. Interesting textual parallel not captured.
  4. **Musk = Gidgiddoni is NOT explicitly stated in transcript.** Philpot says "a strategist named Gid Gadoni" without naming Musk. Identification appears slide-only or audience inference.
  5. **7 verbal-only items not in evaluation:** DHS/ICE "internal army" argument, McCarthy files unsealed 2020, Bolton/Comey indictments as prosecution ladder, corporate fiction argument (broader than SEC fine), storm vs. tempest Webster 1828 distinction, polar shift/nuclear war speculation, preparation deadline urgency ("I got to be prepared by 2029").
  6. **Evaluation quality is GOOD overall.** Core year-by-year, 9/11, and Lachoneus arguments are all captured. "Missed Opportunities" section (Bednar Oct 2024, Isaiah 8:20 test) is the evaluation's strongest original work. Gap is narrower than Phases 2-3 or 5.
- **Evaluation changes made:** Added comprehensive Transcript Review Notes section with verbal-vs-slide mapping table, pharmakeia slide-only discovery, 7 verbal-only items documented, assessment of Phase 6→7 overlap.

### Pass 8: Phase 8a — Harbinger (Part II)
- **Status:** Complete
- **Transcript lines read:** Part II full (reusing Passes 6–7); grep searches across all three transcripts for Phase 8 terms (Jericho, palm tree, half hour, silence, seal, 112, governor, Judah, Daschle, harbinger, bricks, sycamore, etc.)
- **New content found:**
  1. **Phase 8 is the MOST slide-dependent evaluation in the series.** ALL four major arguments (Palmyra/Jericho etymology, half-hour-of-silence calculation, D&C 112/COVID, Judah/governors mapping) have zero or near-zero verbal presence. The Judah/governors parallel is explicitly mentioned and skipped: "I've got 369 slides... the southern kingdom of Judah... I'm not going to go through them all."
  2. **The only Phase 8 content that IS verbal — the Isaiah 9-10/Daschle harbinger — appears at Part II ~49:41, which is Phase 7's timestamp range.** Evaluation correctly identifies slides 269+ as Phase 8, but verbal delivery occurred earlier. Already documented in Phase 7 review.
  3. **The verbal content in Phase 8's assigned timestamps (Part II ~55:00-1:11:00) is ENTIRELY the year-by-year Book of Mormon mapping continuation** — Hinckley Gadianton quote, Lachoneus/Trump, DHS/ICE, 2028 election, BYU "temples of Baal," SEC fine. ALL already documented in Phase 6 and Phase 7 transcript reviews.
  4. **The "hinge point" concept IS verbal but reframed:** At Part III ~12:00, Philpot uses "hinge point" as a harvest-transition label (wheat→grape), NOT the D&C 112/Seventh Seal calculation the evaluation analyzes. Different argument entirely.
  5. **COVID temple closure is verbal but brief and in Phase 9 territory:** Part III ~58:55 Q&A: "What happened to people who fled to the temples on March 26, 2020? They were closed." Three sentences; no D&C 112, no half-hour-of-silence, no "upon my house" framing.
  6. **Evaluation remains EXCELLENT as slide analysis.** The Palmyra/Jericho typology, D&C 112:26 contextual critique, half-hour math critique, Judah/governors demolition, and "stand in holy places" application are all strong exegetical work — just not applicable to the verbal presentation.
- **Evaluation changes made:** Added comprehensive Transcript Review Notes section with verbal-vs-slide mapping table covering all four major arguments, 5 key findings establishing this as the most slide-dependent phase.

### Pass 9: Phase 8b — Hinge Point (Part III)
- **Status:** Complete (merged with Pass 8 — both cover the single Phase 8 evaluation document)
- **Transcript lines read:** Part III full (lines 1–end, ~0:00–1:00:00); grep searches for Phase 8 terms
- **New content found:** See Pass 8 findings above. Part III ~0:00–25:00 verbal content is corporate fiction argument, Lachoneus 2 full scenario, storm/tempest distinction, preparation urgency — ALL already documented in Phase 7 transcript review notes. Phase 8–specific slide content (Palmyra/Jericho, half-hour, Judah/governors, D&C 112) does not appear verbally in Part III either.
- **Evaluation changes made:** Covered in Pass 8 update to 08_harbinger_and_hinge.md.

### Pass 10: Phase 9 — Culmination
- **Status:** Complete
- **Transcript lines read:** Part III full (reusing prior reads; Phase 9 verbal content ~12:00–1:00:00); grep searches across all three transcripts for Kokaubeam, eclipse, chiasmus, Zarahemla, temple ceremony terms
- **New content found:**
  1. **The "Two Great Lights" section (Key Claims 1–3, 5) is entirely slide-only.** Zero transcript hits for Kokaubeam, kōwḵāḇ, kokob, "great light," "two great," chiasmus, foreshadow, or eclipse across all three transcripts. The evaluation's headline achievement — praised as "the best original research in any phase" — was never verbalized.
  2. **The Zarahemla/Hemlah/Dead Sea etymology IS verbal but NOT in the evaluation.** At ~57:54 Philpot connects Hebrew *hemlah* (salt) to both the Dead Sea and Zarahemla, then asks "What's the modern Zarahemla?" — pointing to Salt Lake City. Creative Hebrew word study parallel to the slide-only Kokaubeam work, completely uncaptured.
  3. **10 verbal-only items documented:** Zarahemla etymology, Oaks' first talk analysis (no temples, family proclamation, polygamy papers), 2500=half of 5000/half of 10 virgins, creation week/"first month fourth day"=day 4, temple ceremony changes as prophetic signs, Abinadi/ten commandments/public schools, "third vs. totality" framework, corporate dissolution Q&A, Bountiful as Passover/Sukkot site, "I invite all of you to be crazy with me."
  4. **Phase 9 is second-best-captured phase after Phase 4.** 10 of 15 Key Claims are verbal; evaluation correctly sourced most from transcript timestamps. Out of Line and Missed Opportunities sections are strong. Gap is narrower than Phases 2–3, 5, or 8.
  5. **Title irony:** The evaluation is titled "The Two Great Lights & Culmination" but the "Two Great Lights" section is entirely slide-only. The verbal word study the audience heard (Zarahemla) is not in the evaluation.
- **Evaluation changes made:** Added comprehensive Transcript Review Notes section with verbal-vs-slide mapping table for all 15 Key Claims, 10 verbal-only items documented, key finding about title/content irony.

## Cross-Phase Summary

*All 10 passes complete. Here is the consolidated picture of the slide-vs-verbal pattern across the 9-phase evaluation series.*

### The Quality Spectrum

| Phase | Rating | Verbal Coverage | Key Gap |
|-------|--------|----------------|---------|
| **Phase 4** (Rev 12) | **Best** | All 10 Key Claims verbal AND evaluated | 3 minor verbal-only items |
| **Phase 9** (Culmination) | **Second** | 10/15 claims verbal AND evaluated | Title section (Kokaubeam) entirely slide-only; 10 verbal-only items |
| **Phase 6** (Esdras) | **Good** | Most claims verbal AND evaluated | Scope gap — 7 verbal-only items; Hunter=Samuel unlisted |
| **Phase 7** (Type & Sign) | **Good core** | Year-by-year, 9/11, Lachoneus all captured | Pharmakeia (4 claims) entirely slide-only; 7 verbal-only items |
| **Phase 1** (Foundation) | **Good** | Core framework verbal AND evaluated | 5 verbal-only items (temple sealing, 3 Nephi 7 "four days") |
| **Phase 2** (Signs) | **Slide-dependent** | Only "likening" + Nelson verbal | 6 of 8 Key Claims slide-only (1 Nephi 14, D&C 88, JST Matthew, etc.) |
| **Phase 3** (Apocalyptic) | **Slide-dependent** | None as standalone discussion | All 10 claims slide-only; building blocks appear in Phases 4–5 verbally |
| **Phase 5** (Ezekiel's Eagle) | **Worst divergence** | Verbal content is DIFFERENT from slides | Slides=Ezekiel 17 (zero hits), Verbal=Rev 13 beast identification (18 items unevaluated) |
| **Phase 8** (Harbinger/Hinge) | **Most slide-dependent** | All 4 major arguments have zero verbal presence | Palmyra/Jericho, half-hour calculation, D&C 112/COVID, Judah/governors — all slide-only |

### Structural Findings

1. **The verbal delivery does not follow slide order.** Philpot's 369 slides represent a larger body of work than any single 3-hour presentation can cover. He selectively presents from them, often in a different sequence than the slide numbers suggest, and often improvises extended arguments that aren't on any slide.

2. **The presentation has three distinct presentational layers:**
   - **Slide-only** (never spoken): Kokaubeam, Ezekiel 17, pre-analysis, eclipses, pharmakeia, Palmyra/Jericho, half-hour calculation, D&C 112/COVID, Judah/governors, and most of Phases 2–3
   - **Slide-and-verbal** (shown and discussed): Year-by-year BoM timeline, 9/11=Rev 18, Revelation 12 history, harvest framework, 2025–2033 projections, Ether 13/New Jerusalem, and most of Phases 4, 6–7, 9
   - **Verbal-only** (never on slides): Temple sealing as Second Coming type, corporate fiction argument, Zarahemla etymology, Oaks analysis, temple ceremony changes, Abinadi/ten commandments, 2500=half of 10 virgins, creation week/3 Nephi 8:5

3. **The continuous year-by-year BoM timeline runs across Part II and Part III without phase-aligned breaks.** Content assigned to Phases 6, 7, and 8 in the slides overlaps heavily in the verbal delivery. Phase 8's entire timestamp range contains Phase 6–7 continuation content.

4. **The evaluation quality is highest when the evaluator had close transcript access** (Phases 4, 9) and lowest when relying primarily on slides (Phases 2–3, 8). Phase 5 represents a unique failure mode where the slide content and verbal content are completely different topics.

5. **Verbal-only items total approximately 70+ across all phases.** These represent a parallel "presentation within the presentation" — the ad-libbed, audience-responsive, story-driven layer that the slides don't capture. Many are among Philpot's most compelling (and most problematic) claims.

### Implications for the Evaluation Series

The 9 evaluations remain **valid as written analysis** — the scriptural reasoning, cross-referencing, and doctrinal critique are sound whether the source is a slide or a verbal statement. What changes is the *scope assessment*:

- **Phases 2–3 and 8** evaluate content the Chandler audience never heard (as standalone arguments). They are effectively **slide reviews**, not presentation reviews.
- **Phase 5** evaluates the *wrong* content — the verbal argument (Rev 13 beast identification) is completely uncaptured.
- **Phases 1, 4, 6–7, and 9** accurately evaluate what the audience heard, with scope gaps in verbal-only material.

The strongest evaluative work — the doctrinal critiques, missed opportunities, and "stand in holy places" application — translates regardless of source medium. D&C 49:7 still applies to date-setting whether it was spoken or projected.

*Review completed: 2025-07-26*
*10 passes, 3 transcripts (~168 KB), 9 evaluations, ~70 verbal-only items documented*

- Each pass should take **1–2 rounds** of conversation
- Passes can be done in order or by priority
- Part III Pass 10 (Phase 9) is the highest priority — only 13 slides for 35 minutes means substantial verbal-only content
- Part I Pass 4 (Phase 4) is second priority — the Council of Fifty historical argument likely has more verbal detail than slides captured
- The remaining passes are roughly equal priority

**Estimated total:** 10 passes × 1.5 rounds average = ~15 conversation rounds
