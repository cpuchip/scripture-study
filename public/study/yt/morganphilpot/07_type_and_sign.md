# Phase 7: The Type & Sign — 9/11, Pharmakeia & Year-by-Year Parallels

> Morgan Philpot — *Signs of the Times* (Chandler, AZ, 2025)
> Slides 229–278 | Part II Transcript (~30:00–55:00) | Part III Transcript (~0:00–25:00)

**Evaluation Focus:** This is the core interpretive claim — that the Book of Mormon's Nephite timeline from the sign of Christ's birth maps year-by-year to events starting in 2000. Is the pattern genuine or cherry-picked? Do the 3 Nephi descriptions genuinely match modern events, or is this confirmation bias? The pharmakeia word study is straightforward Greek — verify the Strong's number and usage.

**Bias Alert:** This section combines political interpretation with eschatological claims. The scriptural parallels should be evaluated on their merits, with clear flagging of where the modern mapping requires interpretive leaps vs. where it naturally aligns.

## Step 1: Summary

### Main Thesis

Phase 7 is the interpretive heart of Philpot's entire presentation. Building on the Phase 6 claim that the Palmyra Temple dedication (April 6, 2000) was the modern "sign of Christ's coming" parallel to [3 Nephi 1:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p19#p19), Philpot now argues that the Book of Mormon narrative from 3 Nephi forward maps **year-by-year** to American history from 2000 onward. If Year 1 of the "new reckoning" = 2000, then Year 2 = 2001 (9/11), Year 5 = 2004 (people forget the signs), Year 21 = 2020 (COVID siege), Year 26 = 2025 (Trump/Lachoneus), and ultimately Year 34 = 2033 (great destruction / Second Coming).

This phase weaves together three threads:

1. **9/11 as type of Revelation 18** — The September 11 attacks as a prophetic "type and sign" fulfilling the Babylon-destruction imagery of [Revelation 18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/18?lang=eng): "in one hour" (v. 10, 17, 19), merchants weeping (v. 11), ships watching from afar (v. 17–18), the "twofold" judgment (v. 6, Greek *diplōsate*/*dipla* → two towers).

2. **The year-by-year timeline** — A 130-row spreadsheet ([timeline.md](../../../yt/morganphilpot/timeline.md)) mapping every year from the Reign of Judges (91 BC / 1909) through the new reckoning from Christ's sign (1 AD / 2000) to the great destruction (34 AD / 2033). Key anchor points: Gadianton robbers on mountains ([3 Nephi 1:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) / 2001), people forget signs ([3 Nephi 2:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) / ~2004), Giddianhi's epistle ([3 Nephi 3:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) / ~2016–17), siege ([3 Nephi 4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/4?lang=eng) / COVID 2020), Lachoneus era ([3 Nephi 6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6?lang=eng) / 2025), and Christ's destruction/appearance (3 Nephi 8–11 / 2033).

3. **Pharmakeia and sorcery** — [Revelation 18:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/18?lang=eng&id=p23#p23): "by thy *sorceries* were all nations deceived." The Greek word is φαρμακεία (*pharmakeia*, Strong's 5331), the root of "pharmacy/pharmaceutical." Philpot connects this to [D&C 89:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) — "evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days" — and to [Isaiah 8:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/8?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) — "wizards that peep, and that mutter" — arguing that the modern pharmaceutical industry is the literal fulfillment of Babylon's "sorceries." The Webster 1828 definition of "sorcery" bridges the historical-linguistic gap: "Divination by the assistance, or supposed assistance, of evil spirits."

### Key Claims

**9/11 as type of Revelation 18:**

2. "Merchants of the earth shall weep" (Rev 18:11) maps to the stock market closure and economic devastation (slide 248)
3. "Every shipmaster... stood afar off" (Rev 18:17–18) maps to ships in New York Harbor watching the smoke (slide 249)
4. The Greek *diplōsate*/*dipla* in Rev 18:6 ("double unto her double") = "twofold" = two towers (slides 250–251)

17. [D&C 89:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) prophetically warns of "conspiring men" in connection with substances (slides 269–270)
18. [Isaiah 8:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/8?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) — "wizards that peep, and that mutter" = modern pharmaceutical advertising ("ask your doctor") (slide 278)

## Step 3: Evaluation

### In Line

**1. President Hinckley explicitly compared Gadianton robbers to 9/11 attackers.**

This is not Philpot's interpretation — it is a prophet's. In ["The Times in Which We Live"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2001/10/the-times-in-which-we-live?lang=eng) (October 2001), President Hinckley said:

> "We of this Church know something of such groups. The Book of Mormon speaks of the Gadianton robbers, a vicious, oath-bound, and secret organization bent on evil and destruction. In their day they did all in their power to bring down the Church, to wrest the land from the hands of the righteous... We see the same thing in the present situation."

Philpot's application of the Gadianton robber narrative to modern terrorism has prophetic precedent at the highest level. The text of [3 Nephi 1:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) — "the Gadianton robbers, who dwelt upon the mountains, who did infest the land; for so strong were their *holds* and their *secret places* that the people could not overpower them; therefore they did commit many murders, and did do much slaughter among the people" — is a striking description that Hinckley himself connected to the 9/11 era. The "mountains" and "secret places" imagery resonates with the Afghan cave networks.

**2. The pharmakeia word study is linguistically accurate.**

φαρμακεία (*pharmakeia*, Strong's 5331) does mean drug-related sorcery in Koine Greek, and it is the undisputed etymological root of "pharmacy" and "pharmaceutical." [Revelation 18:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/18?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) says Babylon's nations were deceived "by thy sorceries" — and the Greek word there is *pharmakeia*. This is standard lexicography, not fringe etymology.

Webster 1828 confirms the bridge: "SORCERY — Divination by the assistance, or supposed assistance, of evil spirits; or the power exercised over others by the aid of evil spirits." The pre-modern understanding of "sorcery" encompassed potion-making and drug-based manipulation — the same semantic range as the Greek.

The observation that modern pharmaceutical advertising — "ask your doctor if [drug] is right for you" — fits John's image of nations "deceived" by commercialized *pharmakeia* is at minimum a thought-provoking connection.

**3. D&C 89:4 genuinely warns about "conspiring men" and substances.**

The Word of Wisdom was given "in consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days" ([D&C 89:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89?lang=eng&id=p4#p4)). This is canonically prophetic — the Lord foresaw that substances would be weaponized by "conspiring men." Whether the fulfillment is the tobacco industry, the opioid crisis, processed food, or pharmaceutical overreach, the prophetic principle is built into the revelation.

**4. The "Revelation 18 / 9/11" imagery has real textual parallels.**

Read on its own terms, [Revelation 18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/18?lang=eng) describes a commercial center destroyed suddenly ("in one hour," repeated three times — vv. 10, 17, 19), with merchants weeping over lost trade (v. 11), shipmasters watching smoke from a distance (v. 17–18), and nations deceived by the city's sorceries (v. 23). The World Trade Center was a *trade* center in a port city, destroyed in under two hours, watched by ships in the harbor, with the stock market shuttered for days. The textual resonance is genuine — whether or not one accepts it as prophetic fulfillment.

**5. Elder Bednar teaches the same Helaman/3 Nephi passages as applying to our day.**

In ["In the Space of Not Many Years"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2024/10/35bednar?lang=eng) (October 2024), Elder Bednar cited President Benson: "The Book of Mormon was written for our day." Bednar then drew from [Helaman 6:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) — "all these iniquities did come unto them in the space of not many years" — to argue that spiritual decline in the Book of Mormon is a warning template for *modern Latter-day Saints*. The foundational claim that 3 Nephi has modern application is not Philpot's invention; it is mainstream prophetic teaching.

**6. The Hunter → Family Proclamation connection is documented.**

President Hunter in [October 1994](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1994/10/exceeding-great-and-precious-promises?lang=eng) said: "A worried society now begins to see that the disintegration of the family brings upon the world the calamities foretold by the prophets." Less than a year later, the Family Proclamation (September 1995) used nearly identical language: "the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets." Philpot's observation that Hunter's prophetic warning immediately preceded the Church's most significant family-focused declaration is well-documented.

**7. Isaiah 9:10 was actually quoted on the US Senate floor after 9/11.**

Philpot claims that Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle quoted [Isaiah 9:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/9?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) — "The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones; the sycomores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars" — on September 12, 2001, as a statement of American defiance. This is documented in the Congressional Record. The irony Isaiah intended — this is a statement of *prideful defiance* against God's chastening, not heroic resilience — was apparently lost on the senator. In Isaiah's context, the verse describes Israel's refusal to repent after judgment, leading to *worse* judgment (Isaiah 9:11–12: "Therefore the Lord shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together").

### Nuanced

**1. The Book of Mormon pride cycle is genuinely cyclical — but cyclical is not chronological.**

Philpot's strongest insight is that the 3 Nephi narrative follows a pattern that *rhymes* with modern events: sign given → people forget → prosperity → pride → secret combinations → gathering → siege → brief peace → rapid spiritual collapse → catastrophic destruction. This is a real narrative arc in the text.

But "rhyming" is different from "year-by-year mapping." Cycles repeat throughout human history — the Roman Republic followed a similar arc over centuries. The French Revolution, the Weimar Republic, and dozens of other societies have experienced prosperity-to-collapse sequences. The Book of Mormon's value as prophecy-for-our-day (as Bednar teaches) lies in the *pattern*, not in matching specific BoM years to specific Gregorian years.

**2. Elder Bednar applies the same scriptures — but spiritually, not politically.**

This is the critical distinction. Bednar draws from the *exact same passages* Philpot uses — Helaman 6, the rapid spiritual decline "in the space of not many years" — but applies them as a warning about *personal and institutional pride within the Church*, not as a political timeline mapping Nephite judges to American presidents. Bednar says:

> "Beware of pride, lest ye become as the Nephites of old."

Bednar's application is inward-facing: *Are we, as Latter-day Saints, following the pride cycle?* Philpot's application is outward-facing: *The American republic is following the Nephite decline on a year-by-year schedule.* The scriptural text supports Bednar's reading more naturally, because the Book of Mormon consistently presents pride as the *internal* disease that makes societies vulnerable to external threats (see [Helaman 4:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/4?lang=eng&id=p12#p12): "because of the pride of their hearts, because of their exceeding riches, yea, it was because of their oppression to the poor").

**3. The 4-year "election cycle" observation is interesting but proves less than claimed.**

Philpot observes that Nephite "contentious election years" map to US presidential election years (e.g., "29th year" = 2028). But four-year election cycles are a structural feature of representative government, not a prophetic encoding. The Nephite text doesn't specify four-year judicial terms — chief judges served indefinitely until they resigned, died, or were overthrown. Pahoran served from Alma 50:40 (~67 BC) until his death in Helaman 1:2 (~52 BC) — fifteen years. The "four-year cycle" in the timeline spreadsheet appears to be a modern political framework projected onto the text rather than derived from it.

**4. The Lachoneus/Giddianhi narrative has elements that map and elements that don't.**

What maps: The Gadianton robbers' epistle to Lachoneus ([3 Nephi 3:1–10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p1-p10#p1)) is a masterpiece of political intimidation — Giddianhi demands surrender, flatters the Nephites' "firmness" while threatening destruction, and offers partnership if they "yield up the government." The pattern of an entrenched criminal organization pressuring legitimate government through threats and seduction is timeless and recognizable.

What doesn't map: Lachoneus in 3 Nephi is a *righteous* leader who responds to the threat by (a) praying to God, (b) appointing a prophet-general (Gidgiddoni, "a great prophet among them" — [3 Nephi 3:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p19#p19)), (c) commanding the people to cry unto the Lord for deliverance ([3 Nephi 3:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p25#p25)), and (d) gathering the people with all their provisions. This is a *spiritual* response guided by *prophetic counsel*. Mapping Lachoneus to any modern political figure requires stripping the character of his defining spiritual traits and reducing him to "the leader who gathers the people against an external threat."

**5. "In one hour" may be apocalyptic convention, not chronological precision.**

The phrase "in one hour" appears three times in [Revelation 18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/18?lang=eng) (vv. 10, 17, 19). In apocalyptic literature, "one hour" typically means "suddenly, without warning" — not "within exactly 60–120 minutes." It functions the same way as the modern phrase "overnight" ("the empire collapsed overnight"). The textual resonance with the Twin Towers' collapse timeframe is genuinely striking, but treating apocalyptic temporal language as a stopwatch measurement is a methodological category error.

### Out of Line

**1. Predicting the Second Coming in 2033 is date-setting — something scripture explicitly prohibits.**

[D&C 49:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49?lang=eng&id=p7#p7): "I, the Lord God, have spoken it; but the hour and the day no man knoweth, neither the angels in heaven, nor shall they know until he comes."

[Matthew 24:36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/24?lang=eng&id=p36#p36): "But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only."

Philpot's timeline culminates in "Year 34 = 2033 = great destruction = Christ visits." This is, by definition, date-setting. The year-by-year mapping, once extended to its conclusion, makes a specific chronological claim about the Second Coming. No amount of qualifying language ("I could be wrong") changes the mathematical output: if 1 AD = 2000, then 34 AD = 2033. The Lord has said this is unknown. Prophets, apostles, and angels do not know. Philpot cannot know.

President Nelson in [April 2025](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/57nelson?lang=eng) said: "I do know that the Lord is prompting me to urge us to get ready for that 'great and dreadful day.'" Note what Nelson does NOT say: a year. The prophet's counsel is *preparedness*, not *prediction*. Philpot quotes Nelson's urgency while adding the specificity Nelson deliberately withholds.

**2. The year-by-year timeline is unfalsifiable confirmation bias scaled to 130 rows.**

The timeline spreadsheet maps 130+ years of American history to Book of Mormon events. When there is no notable American event for a given year, the cell is left blank. When there IS a notable event, it is matched to whatever Book of Mormon narrative falls on that year. This is the fundamental methodological flaw:

- **Year 5 / 1913**: Amlici's rebellion → Federal Reserve Act. But the Federal Reserve Act was financial legislation, not a military rebellion. The "parallel" is: something bad happened in both timelines.
- **Year 21 / 1929**: Alma 35 persecution → Stock Market Crash. Alma 35 describes Zoramite religious persecution of converts. The Stock Market Crash was a financial event. The link is thematic mood ("bad times"), not textual correspondence.
- **Year 42 / 1950**: Kishkumen and Gadianton arrive → McCarthy. McCarthy *opposed* communist infiltration; the Gadiantons *were* the infiltrators. The parallel works only if you squint past the directional reversal.
- **Year 68 / 1976**: "Sole management of government" → post-Watergate. [Helaman 6:39](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) says the Gadiantons "did obtain the sole management of the government, insomuch that they did trample under their feet and smite and rend and turn their backs upon the poor and the meek." The 1976 political environment (post-Watergate reforms, Carter election) doesn't obviously match "sole management" by a criminal conspiracy.

With enough flexibility in what counts as a "parallel," any historical sequence can be mapped to any narrative.

**3. Mapping modern political figures to Nephite characters is political commentary in scriptural dress.**

The timeline explicitly identifies: Trump = Lachoneus, Musk = Gidgiddoni, Biden = center head of eagle, Obama = specific year markers. The transcript goes further: the Trump successor will be assassinated in 2029 (= 3 Nephi 7:1), and the Church will be "broken up" (= 3 Nephi 6:14 SEC fine).

This is not scripture study. It is political opinion expressed through scriptural vocabulary. The Book of Mormon is not a Republican or Democratic text. Using it to endorse or condemn specific elected officials transforms prophetic warning into partisan advocacy.

**4. "Church broken up" (3 Nephi 6:14) does not mean SEC compliance fines.**

[3 Nephi 6:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) reads: "And thus there became a great inequality in all the land, insomuch that the church began to be broken up; yea, insomuch that in the thirtieth year the church was broken up in all the land save it were among a few of the Lamanites who were converted unto the true faith; and they would not depart from it."

This describes *spiritual apostasy* — the members of the Church abandoning their faith because of pride and inequality. A few faithful Lamanites cling to the truth. This is the same pattern throughout the Book of Mormon (compare [Helaman 4:11–12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/4?lang=eng&id=p11-p12#p11): "their wickedness and abomination... led them to boast in their own strength").

Philpot maps this to the SEC's 2023 fine for investment disclosure practices. The SEC fine, whatever its significance, has nothing in common with mass spiritual apostasy. The members of the Church did not abandon their faith because of a regulatory compliance penalty. This is precisely the kind of forced parallel that discredits otherwise valid pattern observations.

**5. Lachoneus son of Lachoneus is NOT the same as Lachoneus — the text is explicit.**

[3 Nephi 6:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6?lang=eng&id=p19#p19): "Now it was those judges who had been appointed by the people, and they were appointed because of their nobility... and Lachoneus, the son of Lachoneus, was going to fill the judgment seat of his father." 

[3 Nephi 7:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/7?lang=eng&id=p1#p1): "The chief judge of the land had been murdered." This is Lachoneus *the son*, not the original Lachoneus.

Philpot's timeline maps both father and son to Trump-era figures ("Lachoneus 2" is the Trump successor). But the text is clear: these are two different people in two different narrative roles. The father is the successful defender who rallies the people. The son is the tragic figure whose assassination triggers total governmental collapse. Mapping both to political allies of the same movement collapses a deliberate narrative distinction.

### Missed the Mark

**1. 3 Nephi 4:30–33 shows the Nephites understood their victory was BY FAITH, not by political strategy.**

After defeating the robbers, the Nephites don't celebrate military or political victory. They respond:

> "May the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, protect this people in righteousness, so long as they shall call on the name of their God for protection" ([3 Nephi 4:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p30#p30)).

The Nephites knew their victory was spiritual, not strategic. They "did break forth, all as one, in singing, and praising their God" (v. 31) and "did cry unto the Lord their God, because of his great goodness and his mercy" (v. 33). Philpot's narrative focuses on the political/military structure (Lachoneus as strategic leader), while the text emphasizes that the *only reason* the strategy worked was because the people "had repented" (v. 33).

**2. 3 Nephi 6 tells us *exactly* what broke the church — and it wasn't external enemies.**

The government-robber conflict is resolved by 3 Nephi 5. The *entire* narrative of 3 Nephi 6 is about how prosperity *after* the victory caused spiritual collapse *from within*:

> "And the people began again to have peace in the land... but the people began to be distinguished by ranks, according to their riches and their chances for learning" ([3 Nephi 6:2, 12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6?lang=eng&id=p2#p2)).

The church broke up because members became proud and persecuted the righteous among them (v. 13–14). Prophets were murdered *by* the establishment, not by external robbers (v. 21–23). The lesson of 3 Nephi 6 is that the deadliest enemy is internal pride after external victory — precisely the warning Elder Bednar drew from the same text.

**3. Gidgiddoni was "a great prophet among them" — not a tech entrepreneur.**

[3 Nephi 3:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p19#p19): "Now the chief captain over all the armies of the Nephites was appointed, and his name was Gidgiddoni. Now it was the custom among all the Nephites to appoint for their chief captains, (save it were in their times of wickedness) some one that had the spirit of revelation and also prophecy; therefore, this Gidgiddoni was a great prophet among them, as also was the chief judge, Lachoneus."

Gidgiddoni's defining characteristic is that he was a *prophet* — appointed because of his *spiritual* qualifications. When the people asked him to attack the robbers preemptively, he refused: "The Lord forbid; for if we should go up against them the Lord would deliver us into their hands" ([3 Nephi 3:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p21#p21)). He waited for the Lord's timing. Mapping this character to any modern figure whose primary qualification is non-prophetic misses the text's entire point.

**4. The "twofold/double/two towers" reading of Revelation 18:6 overloads the Greek.**

Revelation 18:6 says: "Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works." The Greek word *diplōsate* means "to give double" — a standard expression of retributive justice (compare [Isaiah 40:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/40?lang=eng&id=p2#p2): "she hath received of the Lord's hand double for all her sins"). Reading *dipla* (double) as "two towers" is a homophonic coincidence, not a lexical argument. "Double" means "twofold in measure," not "a pair of structures."

### Missed Opportunities

**1. Elder Bednar's "In the Space of Not Many Years" (October 2024) is the most relevant conference talk Philpot never cites.**

This is the single biggest missed opportunity in Phase 7. An *apostle* — speaking just months before Philpot's presentation — drew from the *exact same* Helaman/3 Nephi passages and said explicitly:

> "The Book of Mormon is not primarily a historical record that looks to the past. Rather, this volume of scripture looks to the future and contains important principles, warnings, and lessons intended for the circumstances and challenges of *our day*."

Bednar then walked through [Helaman 6:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) and applied it as a warning about *how quickly* spiritual decline can happen within the Church. If Philpot had cited Bednar, he would have had apostolic support for his *foundational* claim (the BoM is about our day) while being confronted with an apostle's *different application* (spiritual pride, not political timeline). The tension between Philpot's political reading and Bednar's spiritual reading would have strengthened the presentation enormously.

**2. 3 Nephi 5:1–3 — the people's response to victory is the key the timeline skips.**

After the robbers' defeat, the text says: "There was not a living soul among all the people of the Nephites who did doubt in the least the words of all the holy prophets... for they knew that it must needs be that they must be fulfilled. And they knew that it must needs be that Christ had come, because of the many signs" ([3 Nephi 5:1–3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/5?lang=eng&id=p1-p3#p1)).

The timeline jumps from military events to political mappings. But the text's emphasis is on *faith confirmed by experience*. The people who survived the siege emerged not as political victors but as *witnesses of prophetic fulfillment*. This is where the text wants the reader to linger.

**3. [D&C 88:91](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p91#p91) — "all things shall be in commotion" — is how the living prophet applied these times.**

President Nelson in [April 2021](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2021/04/36nelson?lang=eng) quoted [D&C 88:91](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p91#p91) to describe post-COVID reality. This verse is part of the same sequence (D&C 88:86–95) that Philpot uses. But Nelson draws no year-by-year timeline from it. He says: "All things shall be in commotion; and surely, men's hearts shall fail them; for fear shall come upon all people." Then he offers *faith and temple covenants* as the response — not chronological forecasting.

The prophet's pattern is: acknowledge the signs → invite preparation → refuse to set dates. This is worth noting.

**4. Isaiah 8:20 contains the scripture's own test — and Philpot reads right past it.**

After the "familiar spirits" and "wizards that peep and mutter" of v. 19, Isaiah delivers the canonical standard for evaluating all interpretive claims:

> "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them" ([Isaiah 8:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/8?lang=eng&id=p20#p20)).

The very scripture Philpot cites for the pharmakeia connection *also contains the test*: Does the interpretation align with "the law and the testimony"? Isaiah's own standard invites exactly the kind of scrutiny this evaluation is performing — and it's a missed opportunity that Philpot quotes v. 19 about wizards without also teaching v. 20's standard of discernment.

### Overall Assessment

Phase 7 contains Philpot's most compelling scriptural observations alongside his most problematic methodological choices.

**What genuinely works:**

The *typological* readings are powerful. The Gadianton-robber narrative resonating with modern terrorism has *prophetic precedent* (Hinckley 2001). The pharmakeia word study is linguistically solid. The Revelation 18 imagery — "in one hour," merchants, ships, sorceries — intersecting with the 9/11 reality is textually striking even if one thinks it's coincidence rather than fulfillment. Elder Bednar applying the same passages to our day (October 2024) validates Philpot's *starting premise* that the Book of Mormon is written for our generation.

And the overarching narrative arc of 3 Nephi — sign → forgetting → prosperity → pride → collapse — is genuinely prophetic in the *pattern* sense. Latter-day Saints across the political spectrum recognize this cycle operating in modern times.

**What does not work:**

The *chronological precision* claim — that year X in the Book of Mormon = year Y in the modern era, reliably enough to predict the 2029 assassination and the 2033 Second Coming — is unfalsifiable pattern-matching. With 130+ years to map, Philpot finds parallels where they exist and leaves blanks where they don't. The methodology is indistinguishable from the numerology and date-setting the scriptures themselves warn against ([D&C 49:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49?lang=eng&id=p7#p7)).

The mapping of specific modern political figures (Trump = Lachoneus, Musk = Gidgiddoni, Biden = center head) is the clearest signal that the framework has become political commentary dressed in scriptural language. Lachoneus's defining trait is that he was a righteous leader guided by prophets. Gidgiddoni's defining trait is that he was *himself* a prophet. These are spiritual categories. Reducing them to political archetypes strips the text of its actual teaching.

**The key question:** Is the Book of Mormon "written for our day" in the sense that its *patterns and principles* warn modern readers? Yes — and Bednar, Hinckley, Benson, and Nelson all teach this. Is it written for our day in the sense that its *chronology* maps year-by-year to the American calendar? That is a much larger claim, and one the prophets themselves have never made.

**The pattern that emerged:** Phase 7 revealed a consistent gap between what the prophets teach from these scriptures and what Philpot teaches:

| Speaker | Same Scriptures | Application |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| President Hinckley (2001) | 3 Nephi / Gadianton | "We see the same thing" — pattern recognition, not year-mapping |
| Elder Bednar (2024) | Helaman 6 | Spiritual pride warning to *Latter-day Saints* — inward application |
| President Nelson (2021, 2025) | D&C 88:91 | "All things in commotion" — invites preparation, refuses dates |
| Philpot (2025) | All of the above + year mapping | Political timeline, specific figures, 2033 date |

The prophets see the patterns and call for repentance. Philpot sees the patterns and builds a calendar. The scriptures support the former approach over the latter.

---

## Step 4: Become

### Truths to Hold

1. **The Gadianton parallel is real and prophetically taught** — President Hinckley drew it explicitly. Secret combinations that seek "power and gain" ([Ether 8:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p23#p23)) are a perennial threat the Book of Mormon was designed to warn about. I don't need a year-by-year mapping to take this warning seriously. Moroni said to "awake to a sense of your awful situation" (v. 24) — present tense, always.

2. **Pharmakeia is worth pondering** — The Greek word in Revelation 18:23 really does mean drug-based sorcery. D&C 89:4 really does warn about "conspiring men in the last days." Whether or not the pharmaceutical industry is *the* fulfillment, the intersecting language is worth honest reflection. What are the "sorceries" by which nations are deceived in 2026?

3. **The Book of Mormon pride cycle applies to ME, not just to "them"** — Elder Bednar's October 2024 talk is the corrective Phase 7 needs. The Book of Mormon's power is not in mapping Nephite events to political headlines. It is in asking: *Am I following the pattern of pride, prosperity, and forgetting?* Am I "boasting in my own strength" ([Helaman 4:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/4?lang=eng&id=p13#p13)) after periods of peace? This is the question the apostle asks. It's the one I should be asking.

4. **"To the law and to the testimony"** — [Isaiah 8:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/8?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) gives the standard. Every interpretive claim — including Philpot's, including my own — must be measured against the law (the scriptures) and the testimony (the living prophets). If it doesn't align, "there is no light in them." The prophets teach preparation without dates. That's the standard.

### Warnings to Heed

1. **Date-setting is seductive because it feels like faith** — Setting a date for the Second Coming feels like taking prophecy seriously. But the Lord said "no man knoweth" ([D&C 49:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49?lang=eng&id=p7#p7)), and adding "but *maybe* we can figure it out" is the very thing He warned against. Urgency should drive preparation, not prediction.

2. **Pattern-matching can become its own idol** — When every year *must* have a parallel, the framework becomes unfalsifiable. If 2028 has a contentious election, the timeline is "confirmed." If 2028 is quiet, that cell is left blank. This isn't testing a hypothesis; it's defending a conclusion. The same confirmation bias Philpot acknowledged in Phase 6 ("you're seeing what you want to see") is unchecked in Phase 7.

3. **Politicizing scripture cuts it off from people who need it** — If the Book of Mormon is "about Trump" or "about Biden," then half the Church stops listening. The Book of Mormon is about *all of us* — prosperity, pride, repentance, and Christ. The moment it becomes partisan prophecy, it loses its power to convert hearts across the political spectrum.

### Commitments

- [ ] Study [3 Nephi 4:30–33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p30-p33#p30) and [3 Nephi 5:1–6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/5?lang=eng&id=p1-p6#p1) — the people's response to victory, where the text wants me to pause
- [ ] Read Elder Bednar's ["In the Space of Not Many Years"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2024/10/35bednar?lang=eng) again slowly and apply it personally — what pride patterns am I ignoring?
- [ ] Memorize [Isaiah 8:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/8?lang=eng&id=p20#p20): "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them" — as the standard for evaluating everything, including my own excited conclusions

### Key Findings

**1. The pharmakeia word study (4 Key Claims) is ENTIRELY slide-only.**

Grep search across all three transcripts confirms: zero mentions of φαρμακεία, pharmaceutical, pharmacy, "conspiring men" (D&C 89:4), "wizards that peep and mutter" (Isaiah 8:19), or the Strong's 5331 reference. The one "sorcery" hit is unrelated (Babylonian Talmud context). The evaluation's In Line #2 ("linguistically accurate") and #3 ("D&C 89:4 genuinely warns") are valid textual analysis — but the audience never heard this argument. The evaluation's Missed Opportunity #4 (Isaiah 8:20 "to the law and to the testimony" as self-contained test) remains excellent analysis but is critique of a SLIDE, not the verbal presentation.

**2. The 9/11 = Revelation 18 argument IS heavily verbal — but the Greek "diplōsate" word study is slide-only.**

The verbal argument follows a DIFFERENT path than the slide:
- **Slides:** Greek diplōsate/dipla → "twofold" → "two towers" (etymological argument)
- **Verbal:** Tower of Babel pride → Isaiah 9–10 northern kingdom tower → John "doubles" the pattern in Rev 18 → "doubling of the fall" = twin towers (narrative/typological argument through Isaiah)

The verbal reasoning is historically richer — it connects Babel, the northern kingdom's pride, and Revelation 18 in a narrative chain. The evaluation critiques the Greek reading (Missed the Mark #4: "diplōsate overloads the Greek") which is valid for the SLIDE but irrelevant to what the audience heard.

**3. The 3 Nephi 2:8 "reckoning change" = Y2K millennial shift is verbal but NOT in the evaluation.**

At ~52:00 Part II: "They change the reckoning of their time. That's what we did in the year 2000. We declared the year 2000 to be the beginning of a new millennium when in fact it was the last year of the old millennium. President Hinckley made a point to call the year 2000 our great new millennial year." This is a specific, interesting textual parallel that the evaluation doesn't capture as a Key Claim.

**4. Musk = Gidgiddoni identification is not explicit in transcript.**

The evaluation's Key Claim 12 says "Musk as Gidgiddoni." Verbally, Philpot says "a strategist named Gid Gadoni" in reference to Trump's administration but does NOT name Musk. The identification appears to be from slides or audience inference. The evaluation's critique (Missed the Mark #3: "Gidgiddoni was a great prophet, not a tech entrepreneur") is still valid but should note the identification is implied, not stated.

**5. Several verbal-only items in the Phase 7 transcript range not in evaluation:**

a. **DHS/ICE "internal army" argument** (~1:02:37 Part II): "Where is Trump putting officers and lawyers like crazy in DHS?… What's Trump building in DHS? An internal army. And who's at the head of it?" — Specific claim about DHS as Lachoneus's military buildup, including employment page references.

b. **McCarthy files unsealed** (~31:00 Part II): "They unsealed the McCarthy files in the Trump administration in 2020. And guess what the files said? McCarthy was right. There were communists in the State Department." — Used to validate the Gadianton = communist infiltration parallel.

c. **Bolton/Comey indictments as prosecution ladder** (Part III ~9:00): "Comey got indicted by a grand jury. Bolton got indicted by a grand jury… If you're going after a terrorist cell, who do you prosecute first? The little guys." — 2025 current events mapped to Lachoneus prosecution of secret combinations.

d. **Corporate fiction argument** (Part III ~0:05–12:00): Much broader than the SEC fine captured in Out of Line #4. Extended argument about corporate personhood as ontological fiction: "You've fragmented your brain to believe something that doesn't exist," government owns all corporate property via corporate charter, nationalization trivially easy once corporate fiction collapses.

e. **Storm vs. tempest Webster 1828 distinction** (Part III ~33:00): "A storm can be a political incursion or a violent assault upon a fortified place. And a tempest can be also a violent assault or a big huge storm." Argues Mormon deliberately uses both words in 3 Nephi 8 to describe political AND natural destruction.

f. **Polar shift / super volcano / nuclear war speculation** (Part III ~35:00): "I've been looking at polar shifts… Science says they exist. Last one was 700,000 years ago. Super volcanoes. We know there's one in Idaho. Nuclear war can cause this." — Speculative destruction mechanisms for 3 Nephi 8 fulfillment.

g. **Preparation urgency with specific deadline** (Part III ~25:00–30:00): "When should I be prepared to go?… I got to be prepared by 2029." Extended argument that travel restrictions and secession in 2030 mean all preparation must be complete before the 2028 election.

**6. The evaluation's quality is GOOD overall — gap is the pharmakeia slide-only discovery plus verbal-only items.**

Unlike Phase 5 (where the entire verbal delivery was unevaluated), Phase 7's core arguments — the year-by-year timeline, the 9/11 parallels, the Lachoneus mapping — are all captured and well-evaluated. The "In Line" assessments hold up against verbal delivery. The "Out of Line" assessments (date-setting, unfalsifiable timeline, political commentary) are well-grounded. The "Missed Opportunities" section (especially Bednar's Oct 2024 talk and Isaiah 8:20's self-test) is the evaluation's strongest original analysis.

**7. Significant overlap with Phase 6 review notes.**

Items documented in the Phase 6 transcript review (hearts turned/temple shift ~54:11, BYU "temples of Baal" ~65:00, assassination prediction ~65:00, SEC fine/felony argument ~67:00) live in the Phase 6→7 bleed zone. The Part II transcript doesn't have clean boundaries between these phases — the year-by-year Book of Mormon mapping runs continuously from ~30:00 to the end of Part II (~1:11:00), spanning Phases 6, 7, and 8a.
