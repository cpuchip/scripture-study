# Phase 2: Signs of the Times & Prophetic Warnings

> Morgan Philpot — *Signs of the Times* (Chandler, AZ, 2025)
> Slides 40–92 | Part I Transcript

**Evaluation Focus:** Are the Nelson quotes in context? Does the "likening" hermeneutic have limits, and does Philpot respect them? Is the two-churches reading of 1 Nephi 14 accurate?

### Transcript Review Notes (2026-02-09)

**Major structural finding:** Phase 2 is the **most slide-dependent phase** of the entire presentation. Of the 8 key claims on slides 40–92, only the "likening" hermeneutic and Nelson's warnings are verbally developed — and the Nelson content appears in **Part III**, not Part I. The remaining Phase 2 content (1 Nephi 14 two-churches, D&C 88 wrath sequence, JST Matthew 1, Woman at the Well, Walk to Emmaus, D&C 121:26–32) exists **only on slides** with no verbal elaboration in any of the three transcripts.

**Verbal vs. slide-only mapping:**

| Content | Slides | Verbal? | Where? |
|---------|--------|---------|--------|
| "Likening" hermeneutic (1 Ne 19:23) | 40 | ✅ | Part I ~1:59–14:30 (captured in Pass 1) |
| Nelson's escalating warnings | 50–58 | ✅ | **Part III** ~12:00–13:00, ~38:19 — NOT Part I |
| 1 Nephi 14 two-churches | 42–48 | ❌ | Slide-only |
| D&C 88 wrath sequence | 67–68 | ❌ | Slide-only ("wrath" appears verbally only in harvest context) |
| Gentile warnings (3 Ne 16/20/21) | 69–77 | ❌ | Slide-only |
| JST Matthew 1 two-question structure | 63–65 | ❌ | Slide-only |
| Woman at the Well (~2034) | 81–85 | ❌ | Slide-only |
| Walk to Emmaus | 86–89 | ❌ | Slide-only |
| D&C 121:26–32 revelation promise | 90–92 | ❌ | Slide-only |
| **2033 from BoM 34th year** | — | ✅ | **Part III** ~16:00–26:00 (verbal-only, different derivation) |
| **Preparation urgency / travel** | — | ✅ | **Part III** ~25:00–32:00 (verbal-only) |
| **Corporate destruction argument** | — | ✅ | **Part III** ~0:05–12:00 (verbal-only) |

**Implications:** The two items rated "Out of Line" (Woman at the Well typology and Walk to Emmaus typology) are **slide-only** — Philpot never verbally defends them. They exist as visual backdrop but receive no oral development. The date calculation also **shifts mechanics**: slides derive ~2034 from John 4:40 + 2 Peter 3:8; the verbal presentation derives **2033** from the Book of Mormon's 34th year chronology — a fundamentally different argument that doesn't require the "one day = 1,000 years" formula.

## Step 1: Summary

### Main Thesis

Having established the four-harvest framework in Phase 1 (barley → wheat → grapes → olives), Philpot now argues that we are living *inside* the transition from the wheat harvest (gathering) to the grape harvest (wrath). His evidence is threefold: (1) President Nelson's increasingly urgent prophetic warnings from 2018–2022, (2) ancient scripture that describes the signs and tribulations preceding the Second Coming, and (3) typological readings of New Testament narrative passages (the Woman at the Well, the Walk to Emmaus) that he claims encode timing information about Christ's return.

The hermeneutic engine for all of this is [1 Nephi 19:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) — Nephi's principle of "likening" the scriptures — which Philpot uses to justify applying ancient patterns to our day. By the end of this section, Philpot has constructed a framework in which the scriptures themselves are sounding an alarm, Nelson is translating that alarm into modern prophetic language, and the listener should be paying attention with unprecedented urgency.

### Key Claims

1. **1 Nephi 19:23 as hermeneutic key** — "Likening" the scriptures justifies applying ancient prophecy directly to latter-day events (slide 40)
2. **Nelson's escalating warnings (2018–2022)** — Six specific conference statements form a crescendo of prophetic urgency (slides 50–58)
3. **1 Nephi 14: Two churches only** — The last-days landscape is binary: the Church of the Lamb vs. the great and abominable church, with no neutral ground (slides 42–48)
4. **D&C 88:84–91 as wrath sequence** — A sequential, imminent cascade: testimony → wrath → earthquakes → tempests → men's hearts failing (slides 67–68)
5. **Jacob's Gentile warnings** — 2 Nephi 6, 3 Nephi 16/20/21: the Gentiles who reject the fulness of the gospel will be swept off (slides 69–77)
6. **"34 AD + 2 days = ~2034 AD"** — The Woman at the Well (John 4:40, Jesus abode "two days" with the Samaritans), combined with 2 Peter 3:8 ("one day is with the Lord as a thousand years"), yields a typological timeline pointing to approximately 2034 AD (slides 81–85)
7. **Walk to Emmaus encodes typological symbols** — Cleophas, the seven miles, the expounding of scriptures: all presented as prophetic types (slides 86–89)
8. **D&C 121:26–32 promises unprecedented revelation** — "Nothing shall be withheld" in the dispensation of the fulness of times; Nelson claims "front-row seats" to these unfoldings (slides 90–92)
9. **2033 from Book of Mormon 34th year** (verbal, Part III) — Philpot derives 2033 from the Book of Mormon chronology: "the 34th year, which is 2033" — where year 0 corresponds to the "sign of the coming of Christ" or "Palmyra sign in 2000." Different from the slide's ~2034 derivation via John 4:40 + 2 Peter 3:8.
10. **Nelson's warnings with personal framing** (verbal, Part III) — Audience member quotes Nelson's last talk: "The Lord is urging me to tell you to prepare for the second coming." Philpot adds: "People like me hear that and I'm like, I got to build a bunker. I got to get off grid." More self-aware and conversational than the six-slide sequence.
11. **Preparation urgency and secession crisis** (verbal, Part III) — Extended practical argument: if secession crisis in 2029–2030 closes borders and kills interstate commerce, "when should you be prepared?" Must be ready before 2028 election. Creates temporal urgency without explicit date-setting.

## Step 2: Discovery

### Supporting Scriptures Found

- [D&C 45:16–75](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45?lang=eng&id=p16-p75#p16) — The Lord's own expansion of the Olivet Discourse, given to the Latter-day Saints directly. Key additions: the Jews shall begin to believe in Christ (v. 51–52), the Mount of Olives splits (v. 48), the "righteous shall be gathered on my right hand unto eternal life" (v. 58). Philpot uses Matthew 24 heavily but doesn't bring in D&C 45.
- [D&C 49:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) — "The hour and the day no man knoweth, neither the angels in heaven, nor shall they know until he comes." Direct counterweight to any timeline-setting.
- [Jacob 5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng) — The Allegory of the Olive Tree: the Lord of the vineyard's painstaking work to preserve the tame olive tree among wild branches (Gentiles). The most extended scriptural treatment of the Gentile-Israel relationship, and directly relevant to the Gentile warnings of 3 Nephi 16/20/21.
- [Mormon 3:17–22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/3?lang=eng&id=p17-p22#p17) — Mormon directly addressing "ye Gentiles… ye twelve tribes of Israel": "Repent, and prepare to stand before the judgment-seat of Christ." Mormon breaks the fourth wall to warn the latter-day reader.
- [Ether 8:23–26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p23-p26#p23) — Moroni's warning about secret combinations: "Wherefore, the Lord commandeth you, when ye shall see these things come among you that ye shall awake to a sense of your awful situation."
- [3 Nephi 30:1–2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/30?lang=eng&id=p1-p2#p1) — Mormon's closing address to the Gentiles: "Turn, all ye Gentiles, from your wicked ways."

### Word Studies

**Liken** (Webster 1828): "To allege, or think, to be like; to represent as like; to compare." This captures an important nuance: likening is *comparison*, not *identification*. When Nephi says "I did liken all scriptures unto us" ([1 Nephi 19:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p23#p23)), he's drawing parallels, not claiming that Isaiah's words were *about* the Nephites in their primary sense. The 1828 definition supports reading "liken" as a tool for application, not as a decoder ring for hidden timelines.

**Wrath** (Webster 1828): "Violent anger; vehement exasperation; indignation... The effects of anger. God's wrath in Scripture is his holy and just indignation against sin." The D&C 88 wrath sequence and the "winepress of the wrath of God" ([Revelation 14:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/14?lang=eng&id=p19#p19)) carry this full weight: not petulance, but holy indignation against unrepentant evil.

## Step 4: Evaluation

### In Line

**1. The Two-Churches Framework of 1 Nephi 14 — Strong**

Philpot's central framing — that 1 Nephi 14:10 establishes a stark binary landscape for the last days — is textually solid. The angel declares to Nephi:

> "There are save two churches only; the one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the church of the devil; wherefore, whoso belongeth not to the church of the Lamb of God belongeth to that great church, which is the mother of abominations" — [1 Nephi 14:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14?lang=eng&id=p10#p10)

This is not Philpot's interpretation; it's the angel's plain statement. There is no middle ground in this vision. What makes it especially relevant is what follows:

- *Numbers few* but *armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory* — [1 Nephi 14:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14?lang=eng&id=p14#p14)
- The wrath of God poured out on "that great and abominable church" — [1 Nephi 14:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14?lang=eng&id=p15#p15)
- "Wars and rumors of wars among all the nations and kindreds of the earth" — [1 Nephi 14:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14?lang=eng&id=p15#p15)
- "The work of the Father shall commence" — [1 Nephi 14:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14?lang=eng&id=p17#p17)

President Boyd K. Packer addressed this framework in at least two general conference talks ([April 2010](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2010/04/the-power-of-the-priesthood?lang=eng), [May 1988](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1988/04/atonement-agency-accountability?lang=eng)), affirming the reality of the two-church construct while exercising caution about specific application. The doctrine is clear; the identification of which specific institutions belong to "the great and abominable church" is where caution is needed. Philpot generally respects this line — he uses the framework to describe spiritual polarity rather than to name institutional enemies.

**2. President Nelson's Prophetic Urgency — Confirmed in Context**

Philpot compiles six Nelson statements from 2018–2022 and presents them as an escalating prophetic alarm. After verifying each source, the quotes are accurately represented:

- **April 2018**: "In coming days, it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost" ([Revelation for the Church](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/04/revelation-for-the-church-revelation-for-our-lives?lang=eng)). Context: Nelson is talking about personal revelation and building on the covenant path. The urgency is real.

- **April 2018** (same talk): "Our Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, will perform some of His mightiest works between now and when He comes again." This is a direct, unambiguous prophetic declaration.

- **October 2020**: "Men's hearts [would fail] them" and "places of security" echoing Captain Moroni ([Embrace the Future with Faith](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2020/10/37nelson?lang=eng)). Context: This was the Saturday Women's Session during COVID-era conference, and Nelson is counseling women specifically about emotional/spiritual safety.

- **April 2020**: "You have front-row seats to witness live what the prophet Nephi saw only in vision" ([Hear Him](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2020/04/45nelson?lang=eng)), directly citing [1 Nephi 14:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14?lang=eng&id=p14#p14). He also says "nothing shall be withheld" from [D&C 121:28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121?lang=eng&id=p28#p28). These are among the most eschatologically explicit statements by a living prophet in recent memory.

- **April 2022**: "We have never needed positive spiritual momentum more than we do now, to counteract the speed with which evil and the darker signs of the times are intensifying" ([Power of Spiritual Momentum](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/04/47nelson?lang=eng)).

The quotes are accurate. The pattern of escalation is real. Where evaluation must be careful is in the *framing*: Philpot threads these quotes into a narrative of imminent, dramatic fulfillment of prophecy. Nelson's consistent message, taken holistically across his ministry, emphasizes *covenant keeping*, *temple worship*, *personal revelation*, and *gathering Israel* — the urgency is about how we live *now*, not about mapping a prophetic countdown. Both emphases are present in Nelson's words. Philpot highlights the eschatological strand; the pastoral strand is equally real.

**3. D&C 88:84–91 Wrath Sequence — Textually Sequential**

The text of [D&C 88:84–91](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p84-p91#p84) is not a grab bag of signs; it is explicitly ordered:

1. "Call upon the nations to repent... testify and warn" (v. 84)
2. "After your testimony cometh wrath and indignation" (v. 85)
3. First angel sounds — "prepared for the great day of the Lord" (v. 86)
4. Second angel — "the great church, the mother of abominations... shall be cast down by devouring fire" (v. 94)
5. Subsequent angels sound — earthquakes (v. 89), thunderings/tempests/waves beyond bounds (v. 90), hailstorm/famine/pestilence (v. 90)
6. "And there shall be great signs in heaven above and in the earth beneath" (v. 91)
7. "And there shall be weeping and wailing among the hosts of men" (v. 91)

Philpot's presentation of this as a *sequence* (testimony first, then wrath unfolds in stages) is faithful to the text. The section uses ordinal markers: "first," "second," etc. The caution is that prophetic sequences in scripture don't always unfold in strict linear fashion — Revelation's own trumpet/bowl/seal sequences are debated as overlapping, not serial. But Philpot doesn't over-claim here; he presents the text's own structure.

**4. The Gentile Warnings in 3 Nephi 16, 20, 21 — Unmistakably Severe**

These are among the most sober passages in all scripture, and Philpot is right to highlight them. The words are Christ's own, spoken to Nephites after his resurrection:

> "At that day when the Gentiles shall sin against my gospel, and shall reject the fulness of my gospel, and shall be lifted up in the pride of their hearts above all nations... I will bring the fulness of my gospel from among them" — [3 Nephi 16:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/16?lang=eng&id=p10#p10)

> "Then shall ye, who are a remnant of the house of Jacob, go forth among them; and ye shall be in the midst of them who shall be many; and ye shall be among them as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep" — [3 Nephi 16:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/16?lang=eng&id=p13#p13), [3 Nephi 20:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/20?lang=eng&id=p16#p16), [3 Nephi 21:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/21?lang=eng&id=p12#p12)

The "lion among sheep" image is repeated across all three chapters — Christ said it at least three times in a single address. This is emphasis, not redundancy. And Jacob added his own corroboration:

> "Wo be unto the Gentiles except they repent; for it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Father, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots" — [3 Nephi 21:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/21?lang=eng&id=p14#p14)

Philpot's use of these passages to warn about Gentile complacency is firmly in line with the scriptural text. The crucial qualifier that he includes (to his credit) is the *conditional* nature: "if the Gentiles will repent" ([3 Nephi 16:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/16?lang=eng&id=p13#p13)), "if the Gentiles will repent... they shall be numbered among my people" ([3 Nephi 21:22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/21?lang=eng&id=p22#p22)). The warnings are real; the door of mercy remains open.

**5. D&C 121:26–32 — Unprecedented Revelation Promised**

The text of [D&C 121:26–32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121?lang=eng&id=p26-p32#p26) is sweeping in scope:

> "God shall give unto you knowledge by his Holy Spirit, yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, that has not been revealed since the world was until now" (v. 26)

> "A time to come in the which nothing shall be withheld" (v. 28)

> "All thrones and dominions, principalities and powers, shall be revealed and set forth upon all who have endured valiantly for the gospel of Jesus Christ" (v. 29)

> "According to that which was ordained in the midst of the Council of the Eternal God of all other gods before this world was" (v. 32)

President Nelson's "front-row seats" and "nothing shall be withheld" references draw directly from this section. The text promises revelation of a scope not previously seen. Philpot is correct to connect Nelson's language to these verses. The question of *timing* — whether we are living through this fulfillment right now or whether it describes a future intensification — is a legitimate discussion. Nelson's own words ("front-row seats to witness live") suggest he believes the window is now open.

### Nuanced — Handle with Care

**1. The "Likening" Hermeneutic and Its Limits**

Philpot's entire approach rests on [1 Nephi 19:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p23#p23): "I did liken all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning." This becomes his license to treat narratives (Woman at the Well, Walk to Emmaus) as prophetic types encoding timeline information.

The Webster 1828 definition of "liken" is instructive: "To allege, or think, to be like; to represent as like; **to compare**." Likening is *comparison for application*, not decryption of hidden meaning. When Nephi likened Isaiah to the Nephites, he was drawing parallels between Israel's covenant situation and his own people's covenant situation — the *same pattern* applied to a new context. He was not extracting numerical codes or hidden calendrical markers from Isaiah's narratives.

Philpot respects the hermeneutic when he applies the Gentile warnings (3 Nephi 16/20/21) to modern circumstances — that's genuine likening: the *same covenant dynamic* (Gentiles receive gospel → reject it → face consequences) operating in our day. He *stretches* the hermeneutic when he treats John 4:40 ("he abode there two days") as an encoded timeline. The narrative of the Woman at the Well is a story about Jesus ministering to Samaritans, not a prophetic riddle.

The principle: likening works best when we apply *patterns and principles* ("if the Gentiles reject the fulness, God will work through the remnant instead"). It works less well when we extract *numbers from narratives* ("two days = two thousand years, therefore 2034 AD").

**2. Nelson's Urgency: Eschatological vs. Pastoral**

Every Nelson quote on Philpot's slides is verified and accurate. The nuance is in *framing*. When Philpot presents six Nelson statements sequentially on slides 50–58 with titles implying an escalating alarm, the visual effect is dramatic. But each statement also has a pastoral context:

- "It will not be possible to survive spiritually without the Holy Ghost" (2018) — Nelson's immediate application was about *personal revelation*, not about mapping the wrath sequence
- "Men's hearts failing them" (2020) — Given to women during COVID, in the context of *emotional resilience and trusting God*
- "Darkened signs of the times are intensifying" (2022) — Nelson pivots immediately to "We can *do something about this*" — spiritual momentum via daily repentance, temple, Book of Mormon

Nelson's message consistently combines alarm ("the times are perilous") with empowerment ("you have the covenant tools to navigate this"). Philpot emphasizes the alarm. The empowerment is equally important and actually *more* predominant in Nelson's pattern of teaching.

This isn't "out of line" — the alarm is genuinely there in Nelson's words. But presenting the alarm divorced from the action steps risks leaving listeners anxious rather than empowered, which is the opposite of what Nelson intends.

**3. JST Matthew 1 and the Two-Question Structure**

Philpot's synoptic comparison (slides 61–65) reflects genuine biblical scholarship. Joseph Smith—Matthew 1:4 makes explicit what's implicit in the KJV: the disciples asked *two* questions — one about Jerusalem's destruction, one about the end of the world. The JST then separates the answers:

- Verses 5–20: About Jerusalem's destruction (70 AD)
- Verse 21: "I speak these things unto you for the elect's sake" — transition marker
- Verses 22–37: About the last days and Second Coming

This two-question structure is textually clear and is an important contribution of the JST. Philpot's use of it is sound. The complexity lies in the phrase "again shall the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, be fulfilled" ([JS—M 1:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1?lang=eng&id=p32#p32)): the word "again" indicates a *dual fulfillment* — once at Jerusalem, once in the last days. This supports a "pattern-based" reading of prophecy (the same divine pattern repeats) that aligns with legitimate likening.

### Out of Line

> **Note (Transcript Review):** Both items below are **slide-only content** — Philpot never verbally elaborates on the Woman at the Well typology or the Walk to Emmaus in any of the three transcripts. They appear on slides 81–89 but receive no oral defense. Additionally, the date calculation **shifts mechanics** in the verbal presentation: instead of the slide's ~2034 (John 4:40 + 2 Peter 3:8), Philpot verbally derives **2033** from the Book of Mormon's 34th year chronology — anchored to "the sign of the coming of Christ or the Palmyra sign in 2000." This is a fundamentally different argument (pattern-matching within Book of Mormon chronology) rather than a "one day = 1,000 years" calendar formula.

**1. "34 AD + 2 Days = ~2034 AD" — Speculative Date-Setting**

This is the most problematic claim in Phase 2. The argument (slides 81–85):

1. Jesus visited the Samaritans after speaking with the Woman at the Well
2. "He abode there two days" ([John 4:40](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/4?lang=eng&id=p40#p40))
3. "After two days he departed" — and then "the Galilaeans received him" ([John 4:43, 45](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/4?lang=eng&id=p43#p43))
4. Per [2 Peter 3:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-pet/3?lang=eng&id=p8#p8), "one day is with the Lord as a thousand years"
5. Therefore: Christ's ministry to the Samaritans (non-Israelites/Gentiles) for "two days" represents 2,000 years of gospel going to the Gentile world
6. Starting from ~34 AD → ~2034 AD, after which Christ "departs" from the Gentiles and returns to Israel/Galilee

The problems:

**The text of John 4 is narrative, not prophetic.** John is recording what happened in a Samaritan town. The "two days" is a historical detail: Jesus stayed two days. He then left. John does not signal that this carries typological weight. There is no "thus we see" or "this is a type" marker of the kind found in, say, Alma 37:45 or 1 Corinthians 10:11.

**2 Peter 3:8 is about divine patience, not a calendar formula.** Peter's point is that God's apparent "delay" in fulfilling promises is not delay at all: "The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward" ([2 Peter 3:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-pet/3?lang=eng&id=p9#p9)). Peter is answering the scoffers who say "Where is the promise of his coming?" ([2 Peter 3:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-pet/3?lang=eng&id=p4#p4)). Using this verse as a mathematical conversion factor (1 day = 1,000 years) inverts its purpose.

**Jesus himself forbids this calculation.** "But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only" ([Matthew 24:36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/24?lang=eng&id=p36#p36)). The Restoration reinforces this: "The hour and the day no man knoweth, neither the angels in heaven, nor shall they know until he comes" ([D&C 49:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49?lang=eng&id=p7#p7)). Any framework that arrives at a specific date or narrow window contradicts these explicit declarations.

**The "Samaritans = Gentiles" premise is imprecise.** Samaritans were a mixed population — partial Israelite descent, partial other nations (see [2 Kings 17:24–41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/17?lang=eng&id=p24-p41#p24)). Jesus himself told the Twelve: "Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not" ([Matthew 10:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/10?lang=eng&id=p5#p5)) — distinguishing Samaritans from Gentiles. The typological equation (Samaritans = Gentile world) doesn't hold precisely.

This doesn't make the Woman at the Well irrelevant to latter-day application. The harvest language in John 4:35 ("the fields are white already to harvest") connects beautifully to D&C 4:4 — Philpot himself made this connection in Phase 1. But the step from "interesting narrative parallel" to "prophetic calendar" crosses a line that the text does not support.

**2. Walk to Emmaus as Encoded Prophetic Timeline — Unsupported**

Slides 86–89 present the Walk to Emmaus ([Luke 24:13–35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/24?lang=eng&id=p13-p35#p13)) as carrying typological significance:

- Cleophas is named — Philpot implies etymological significance
- The distance is seven miles — suggested as symbolically meaningful
- Jesus expounds "in all the scriptures the things concerning himself" (v. 27) — interpreted as a pattern for our dispensation
- "Their eyes were opened, and they knew him" (v. 31) — interpreted as a type of latter-day unveiling

The Emmaus narrative is among the most beautiful passages in all scripture, and Luke 24:32 ("Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?") has profound devotional application. But the text presents a *historical account of a post-resurrection appearance*, not a prophetic parable. Unlike the sower parable (where Jesus explicitly says it carries deeper meaning, [Mark 4:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/4?lang=eng&id=p11#p11)), or the olive tree (where the Lord of the vineyard explains the allegory, [Jacob 5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng)), the Emmaus story comes with no interpretive key suggesting we should decode its details.

The spiritual principle — Christ opens our understanding of scripture when we walk with him — is beautifully true without needing the narrative to be a prophetic cipher. Extracting timeline data from the number of miles or the etymology of Cleophas goes beyond what the text warrants.

### Missed the Mark

**Nelson's Warnings Without Nelson's Remedies**

Philpot's six-slide Nelson sequence (50–58) faithfully presents the alarm. But every one of these Nelson talks includes specific, actionable counsel that Philpot largely omits from his slides:

- **2018**: "Immerse yourself in the glorious light of the Restoration" → study *Come, Follow Me*, deepen personal revelation practice
- **2020 ("Hear Him")**: "Our Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, will perform some of His mightiest works between now and when He comes again. We are each invited to participate" → temple work, ministering, covenant-keeping
- **2020 ("Embrace the Future")**: "Places of security" → covenants, temple, obedience — Moroni's preparation was *work*, not speculation
- **2022**: "Five truths about spiritual momentum" → daily repentance, temple, Book of Mormon, scripture study, time away from social media

Nelson's pattern is consistently **alarm + action**: "The times are urgent; here is exactly what to do." By isolating the alarm and arranging it as an eschatological crescendo, Philpot unintentionally inverts the emphasis. The prophet's primary message is not "Watch the clock" but "Get to work."

This matters because the listener who walks away from Phase 2 thinking "2034 is coming" has absorbed the wrong lesson from Nelson. The listener who walks away thinking "The prophet says I need the Holy Ghost, the temple, the Book of Mormon, and daily repentance *right now*" has absorbed the right one.

### Missed Opportunities

**1. D&C 45 — The Lord's Own Olivet Discourse to Latter-day Saints**

Philpot uses Matthew 24 and JST Matthew 1 extensively but does not reference [D&C 45](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45?lang=eng), where the Lord *re-delivers* the Olivet Discourse directly to the Restoration church. D&C 45 includes material not found in the synoptic accounts:

- The *Jews* "shall begin to believe in Christ" when they see the wounds in his hands and feet ([D&C 45:51–52](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45?lang=eng&id=p51-p52#p51)) — expanding the Gentile-Israel transition Philpot is describing
- "The righteous shall be gathered on my right hand unto eternal life" ([D&C 45:58](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45?lang=eng&id=p58#p58))
- The parable of the ten virgins in latter-day context ([D&C 45:56–57](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45?lang=eng&id=p56-p57#p56))
- "Stand in holy places, and be not moved, until the day of the Lord come" ([D&C 45:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45?lang=eng&id=p32#p32))

For a presentation about latter-day signs, D&C 45 is the *Restoration's own version* of the material — and it's missing.

**2. Jacob 5 — The Allegory of the Olive Tree**

Philpot's Gentile warning material from 3 Nephi 16/20/21 would be enriched immeasurably by [Jacob 5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng). The allegory is the most sustained scriptural treatment of the relationship between Israel (the tame olive tree) and the Gentiles (wild branches). It shows the Lord of the vineyard's grief when wild branches take over, his painstaking efforts to graft in and preserve, and the final climactic gathering. The allegory also happens to involve *olive trees* — connecting directly to the olive harvest framework Philpot established in Phase 1.

**3. Mormon's Direct Address to Latter-day Readers**

The Book of Mormon editors repeatedly break the fourth wall to address the reader who will hold the record:

- [Mormon 3:17–22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/3?lang=eng&id=p17-p22#p17): "I speak unto you, ye Gentiles... Repent, and prepare to stand before the judgment-seat of Christ"
- [3 Nephi 30:1–2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/30?lang=eng&id=p1-p2#p1): "Turn, all ye Gentiles, from your wicked ways"
- [Ether 8:23–26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p23-p26#p23): Moroni's warning about secret combinations: "When ye shall see these things come among you... ye shall awake to a sense of your awful situation"

These are not distant prophecies being "likened" — they are *directly addressed to us*. They would powerfully reinforce Philpot's Gentile warning material and carry more weight than typological inferences from narratives.

**4. D&C 49:7 — The Anti-Date-Setting Verse**

Given that Philpot's slides arrive at an implied ~2034 window, honesty requires acknowledging the clearest Restoration counter-text: "The hour and the day no man knoweth, neither the angels in heaven, nor shall they know until he comes" ([D&C 49:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49?lang=eng&id=p7#p7)). This verse doesn't say "approximate decade"; it says "the hour and the day." The spirit of the command is clear: prepare urgently, but don't calculate.

### Overall Assessment

Phase 2 is the argumentative engine of Philpot's presentation — this is where the eschatological urgency is built. Its quality is uneven in a revealing way:

**When Philpot works from scripture, he is strong.** The 1 Nephi 14 two-churches framework is textually solid. The D&C 88 wrath sequence is faithfully presented. The Gentile warnings from 3 Nephi 16/20/21 are devastating in their clarity and appropriately applied to modern Gentile complacency. The JST Matthew two-question structure is sound biblical-Restoration scholarship.

**When Philpot works from Nelson, he is accurate but lopsided.** Every quote checks out. But the framing isolates prophetic alarm from prophetic counsel, leaving an impression of countdown urgency that Nelson himself would likely not endorse without the corresponding emphasis on covenant action.

**When Philpot works from typological inference, he is speculative.** The "34 AD + 2 days = ~2034 AD" reading of the Woman at the Well extracts a calendar from a narrative that does not claim to be prophetic. The Walk to Emmaus typology assigns symbolic value to historical details without scriptural warrant. These are the weakest elements of the presentation, and they risk discrediting stronger material by proximity.

**The core message is sound; the methodology has limits.** "The signs of the times are real, the prophets are warning us, and scriptures contain patterns that illuminate our moment" — all true. "This specific narrative detail yields this specific date" — that's a bridge too far. The listener who holds the strong material (prophetic warnings, covenant urgency, Gentile accountability) while releasing the speculative material (date calculations, narrative cipher reading) will get the most value from Phase 2.

**Recommendation:** Study 1 Nephi 14 and 3 Nephi 16/20/21 carefully — these are genuinely urgent scriptures that deserve more attention than they typically receive. Take Nelson's warnings seriously *and* take his counsel seriously. Hold the Woman at the Well and Walk to Emmaus typologies very loosely, or set them aside entirely. The urgency of preparation does not require a date on the calendar; [D&C 29:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) says we gather "to prepare their hearts" — that's a state of being, not a countdown.

## Step 5: Become

> *"Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection."* — [D&C 130:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130?lang=eng&id=p18#p18)

### Truths to Apply

- **The two-churches reality is now.** 1 Nephi 14:10 doesn't describe a future polarization — it describes the *current* spiritual landscape. There is no neutral ground. Every choice either builds the kingdom of God or serves the other. This is sobering, not as a geopolitical statement, but as a daily spiritual inventory: Where do my attention, resources, time, and loyalty actually go?

- **The Gentile warnings apply to me.** It's easy to read 3 Nephi 16 and think of "the Gentiles" as someone else — the secular world, the culture at large. But I am a Gentile reading a book written for Gentiles. Mormon and Moroni addressed these warnings to me. "If the Gentiles will repent, it shall be well with them" ([3 Nephi 16:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/16?lang=eng&id=p13#p13)). Repentance is the response, not hand-wringing about the state of the world.

- **Nelson's urgency demands action, not anxiety.** "You will not be able to survive spiritually without the Holy Ghost." The verb is *survive*. The remedy is *seek*. Every Nelson warning comes paired with specific counsel: personal revelation, temple covenants, Come Follow Me study, ministering. The urgency is real; the path forward is clear.

- **D&C 121 promises revelation for the faithful.** "A time to come in the which nothing shall be withheld." This is not a prediction to analyze; it's a promise to live into. The condition is enduring "valiantly for the gospel of Jesus Christ" ([D&C 121:29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121?lang=eng&id=p29#p29)). Revelation comes through covenant faithfulness, not through prophetic speculation.

### Warnings to Heed

- **Date-setting dishonors the Master's own words.** "Of that day and hour knoweth no man" ([Matthew 24:36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/24?lang=eng&id=p36#p36)). Any framework that arrives at a year — even by implication — must be tested against this prohibition. The wise course: prepare as if Christ comes tomorrow, plan as if he delays a century, worry about neither timeline.

- **Typological reading can become eisegesis.** The difference between reading *out of* the text (exegesis) and reading *into* the text (eisegesis) is always the question: "Does the text itself claim to be a type?" When Paul says Christ is the firstfruits ([1 Corinthians 15:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p20#p20)), the text claims it. When John says Jesus stayed two days with the Samaritans ([John 4:40](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/4?lang=eng&id=p40#p40)), the text does not. We can learn from narratives without making them into ciphers.

- **Alarm without empowerment produces fear, not faith.** The prophets warn because they also know the remedy. If a study of the signs produces fear and obsession with the calendar, something has gone wrong. If it produces urgency to repent, to seek the Spirit, and to keep covenants — it's bearing the right fruit.
