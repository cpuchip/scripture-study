## Step 1: Summary

### Presenter's Main Thesis

Morgan Philpot argues that the ancient Israelite agricultural cycle — specifically the four harvests (barley, wheat, grapes, olives) and their associated feasts — forms a divinely appointed typological framework that maps onto the plan of salvation, the ministry of Christ, and the events of the last days. Just as Moses' dispensation pointed forward to Christ's *first* coming through Passover and its symbols, Joseph Smith's dispensation points forward to Christ's *second* coming through latter-day revelations, events, and appointed times.

> "The restoration of the gospel was of course about ordinances, but it's really about the second coming."
> — [Morgan Philpot, ~20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c98WG4NN48A&t=1200)

### Key Claims

1. **Dispensational parallel:** Moses' feasts and symbols → First Coming; Joseph's revelations and events → Second Coming (slides 2–3)
2. **The Restoration is spring:** The First Vision (spring 1820) and the Church's organization (April 6, 1830) both occurred in spring — the season of Passover (slides 4–5)
3. **The 4-harvest framework** (slide 34):
   - **Barley** (Passover/Firstfruits) → Christ as Redeemer, "firstfruits of them that slept" → Resurrection, 33 AD
   - **Wheat** (Pentecost/Feast of Weeks) → Christ as Lawgiver/Bridegroom → The Restoration, "field is white"
   - **Grapes** (Trumpets/Atonement) → Christ as Judge/Avenger → The wrath phase
   - **Olives** (Tabernacles/Ingathering) → Christ as Anointed King → Adam-ondi-Ahman, Millennial reign begins
4. **3 Nephi destruction on the 4th day:** The catastrophe in [3 Nephi 8:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/8?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) occurred "in the first month, on the fourth day of the month" — positioned by Philpot as the 4th day of Passover week, coinciding with the crucifixion (slides 13–15)
5. **D&C 45 as a summer warning:** The fig-tree parable in [D&C 45:37–38](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45?lang=eng&id=p37-p38#p37) — "summer is now nigh at hand" — signals that the grape/wrath harvest is approaching (slide 6)
6. **Adam-ondi-Ahman as the olive harvest:** The gathering described in [D&C 116](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/116?lang=eng) and [Daniel 7:9–14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/7?lang=eng&id=p9-p14#p9) is the final "pressing" where the oil of all dispensations is gathered and consecrated upon Christ as King (slides 31–32)
7. **Creation / Holy Week / 7000 Years / 7 Seals** all follow the same 7-phase divine pattern (slides 35–38, introduced but not developed in Phase 1)

### Word Studies

**Abib** (Webster 1828): "The first month of the Jewish ecclesiastical year, corresponding nearly to our April. After the Babylonish captivity this month was called Nisan." Philpot's slide 9 adds the Hebrew meaning of "green" or "newly ripened ears of grain" — consistent with the agricultural framing and confirmed by [Leviticus 2:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/2?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) references to "green ears."

**Harvest** (Webster 1828): "The gathering of a crop of any kind; the ingathering of the crops; also, the season of gathering grain and fruits, late summer or early autumn. Seedtime and harvest... shall not cease. Gen viii. 22." The definition emphasizes harvest as both the *act* and the *season* — supporting the idea that God's appointed feasts were tied to agricultural seasons with prophetic significance.

## Step 4: Evaluation

### In Line

**1. Christ as the Firstfruits of Barley Harvest — Strong**

This is Philpot's strongest typological connection. The scriptural chain is tight:

- [Leviticus 23:10–11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/23?lang=eng&id=p10-p11#p10): "Ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: And he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord... on the morrow after the sabbath." The timing — during Unleavened Bread, right after Passover — places this during the barley harvest season in ancient Israel.
- [1 Corinthians 15:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p20#p20): "But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept." Paul explicitly uses the firstfruits language.
- [1 Corinthians 15:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p23#p23): "Every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming." The word "order" (*tagma*) implies a sequence — firstfruits first, then the main harvest later.

Christ rose on "the morrow after the sabbath" during Passover week — the precise day the wave sheaf was offered. Philpot's identification of Christ as the barley firstfruits is not novel; it's a recognized biblical typology. Elder Howard W. Hunter traced the same Passover connection: "From the time the firstborn of the faithful children of Israel had been 'passed over'... the Passover meal, with all its symbolic emblems and gestures, had been faithfully observed by Israel's families" ([April 1974 General Conference](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1974/04/his-final-hours?lang=eng)).

**2. Wheat Harvest = Pentecost — Strong**

The biblical text confirms this directly:

- [Leviticus 23:15–17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/23?lang=eng&id=p15-p17#p15): Count fifty days from the firstfruits wave sheaf, then offer "two wave loaves... of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the Lord." Fine flour is wheat flour. The firstfruits offering moved from raw barley to baked wheat — from individual sheaf to paired loaves.
- [Deuteronomy 16:9–10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/16?lang=eng&id=p9-p10#p9): "Seven weeks shalt thou number... from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn. And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks."

The barley → wheat progression (Passover → Pentecost) is embedded in the Mosaic law itself. [Exodus 23:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/23?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) names them explicitly: "the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field."

**3. Two Distinct Harvest Phases in Revelation 14 — Strong**

Philpot's claim that the grain harvest and grape harvest represent two different phases of judgment finds direct support in the text:

- [Revelation 14:14–16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/14?lang=eng&id=p14-p16#p14): "Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe." — The grain harvest.
- [Revelation 14:17–20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/14?lang=eng&id=p17-p20#p17): A *separate* angel with a sharp sickle: "Gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe." Cast into "the great winepress of the wrath of God." Blood flows to the horse bridles for 1,600 furlongs.

These are presented as two sequential events with different instruments, different harvests, and different outcomes. [Joel 3:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/joel/3?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) puts both images together: "Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great." [Isaiah 63:1–3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/63?lang=eng&id=p1-p3#p1) adds: "I have trodden the winepress alone... their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments."

**4. The Wheat-and-Tares Framework — Strong**

The scriptural support here is layered:

- [Matthew 13:24–30, 37–39](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/13?lang=eng&id=p24-p30#p24): Jesus' parable explicitly states: "The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one... the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels" (vv. 38–39).
- [D&C 86:1–7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/86?lang=eng&id=p1-p7#p1): The Lord's own expanded interpretation: "Let the wheat and the tares grow together until the harvest is fully ripe; then ye shall first gather out the wheat from among the tares, and after the gathering of the wheat, behold and lo, the tares are bound in bundles, and the field remaineth to be burned" (v. 7).

Notably, D&C 86 *reverses* the order from Matthew 13:30 ("gather ye together first the tares"). In the Restoration version, the wheat (righteous) is gathered *first*. This detail strengthens Philpot's sequential framework — the wheat harvest (gathering of the Saints) precedes the destruction of the wicked.

**5. "Field Is White Already to Harvest" — Strong**

[D&C 4:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4?lang=eng&id=p4#p4): "For behold the field is white already to harvest." This language echoes [John 4:35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/4?lang=eng&id=p35#p35): "Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest." The Lord repeated this phrase in at least six Doctrine and Covenants sections ([D&C 4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4?lang=eng), [6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6?lang=eng), [11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11?lang=eng), [12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/12?lang=eng), [14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/14?lang=eng), [33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/33?lang=eng)). The "eleventh hour" urgency in [D&C 33:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/33?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) adds: "It is the eleventh hour, and the last time that I shall call laborers into my vineyard."

**6. Adam-ondi-Ahman as Dispensational Gathering — Strong**

- [D&C 116:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/116?lang=eng&id=p1#p1): "The place where Adam shall come to visit his people, or the Ancient of Days shall sit, as spoken of by Daniel the prophet."
- [Daniel 7:9–14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/7?lang=eng&id=p9-p14#p9): The Ancient of Days sits in council (v. 9–10), the Son of Man receives "dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him" (v. 14).
- [D&C 107:53–57](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng&id=p53-p57#p53): The *original* gathering — Adam called Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, and Methuselah "into the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman, and there bestowed upon them his last blessing." "The Lord appeared unto them" (v. 54).

Elder Neal A. Maxwell confirmed the prophetic expectation: "The valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman will ring again — this time with the sounds of dispensational reunion, as it glows with gathering" ([October 1986 General Conference](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1986/10/god-will-yet-reveal?lang=eng)). Elder McConkie taught the gathering of all dispensational keys: "A whole and complete and perfect union, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers, and glories... from the days of Adam even to the present time" ([D&C 128:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128?lang=eng&id=p18#p18), cited in his [April 1983 talk](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1983/04/the-keys-of-the-kingdom?lang=eng)).

**7. Feast of Tabernacles in the Millennium — Strong**

[Zechariah 14:9, 16–17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/14?lang=eng&id=p9#p9): After the Lord's feet stand on the Mount of Olives (v. 4) and he becomes "king over all the earth" (v. 9), "every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles" (v. 16). This is one of the most explicit post-Second-Coming prophecies in the Old Testament and directly supports Philpot's placement of Tabernacles as the final feast in the timeline.

### Nuanced — Handle with Care

**1. "Field Is White" as Specifically a Wheat Harvest Metaphor**

Philpot positions D&C 4:4 as a *wheat harvest* reference within his four-harvest framework. The scripture itself doesn't specify which grain. Jesus spoke these words in [John 4:35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/4?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) about a spiritual harvest of souls ("he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal," v. 36).

However, the inference is reasonable: "white" fields describe grain ready for harvest (wheat and barley both turn golden/white when ripe). The timing of D&C 4 (February 1829, during the Restoration's "Pentecost season" in Philpot's framework) and the wheat-specific harvest language of the Pentecost feast ([Leviticus 23:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/23?lang=eng&id=p17#p17)) make the connection plausible though not explicit. This is a typological inference, not a declared doctrine.

**2. 3 Nephi 8:5 — "First Month, Fourth Day" and Passover Timing**

This is the most complex calendrical claim. [3 Nephi 8:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/8?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) reads: "In the thirty and fourth year, in the first month, on the fourth day of the month, there arose a great storm." Philpot's slide titles this "Passover Week – Day 4."

The difficulty: In the Jewish calendar, Passover (the killing of the lamb) occurs on Nisan *14*, not Nisan 4. The lamb is brought into the household on the *10th* ([Exodus 12:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/12?lang=eng&id=p3#p3)). The "fourth day of the first month" doesn't directly correspond to the 14th of Nisan or to the 4th day of "Passover week" (no matter how you count).

Philpot acknowledges this tension on slide 16: "We have no way to correctly reckon time" and quotes Rabbi Louis Jacobs: "There is no pretense that our calendar reproduces the precise times used in Temple days." His conclusion: "All we can do is try to understand the types and signs."

The standard Latter-day Saint understanding holds that the destruction in 3 Nephi coincided with the crucifixion, based on:
- Three hours of destruction ([3 Nephi 8:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/8?lang=eng&id=p19#p19)) paralleling three hours of darkness at Golgotha ([Mark 15:33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/15?lang=eng&id=p33#p33))
- Three days of darkness (3 Nephi 8:23) paralleling three days in the tomb
- The risen Christ's own appearance shortly after ([3 Nephi 11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng))

The calendrical puzzle remains genuinely unresolved. Philpot is on solid ground connecting the event to the crucifixion; the "Day 4" label on his slide is a shorthand that papers over the numerical gap. This deserves more caution than the slide gives it.

**3. The Grape Harvest Linked to Trumpets/Atonement Feasts**

Philpot's table (slide 34) maps:
- Grapes → Trumpets/Atonement → Judge/Avenger → Wrath phase

The grape harvest in Israel *does* overlap with late summer/early fall, close to the seventh-month feasts of Trumpets ([Leviticus 23:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/23?lang=eng&id=p24#p24)) and Atonement ([Leviticus 23:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/23?lang=eng&id=p27#p27)). The association of grapes with divine *wrath* is well supported ([Revelation 14:19–20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/14?lang=eng&id=p19-p20#p19), [Joel 3:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/joel/3?lang=eng&id=p13#p13), [Isaiah 63:1–6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/63?lang=eng&id=p1-p6#p1)). But the specific feast-to-harvest-to-Christological-role mapping in the chart is Philpot's interpretive framework. The scriptures never explicitly say "the Feast of Trumpets represents the grape harvest judgment." The connection is plausible but inferred.

**4. The Olive Harvest = Adam-ondi-Ahman / Anointing of Christ as King**

This is Philpot's most creative contribution. His reasoning:

1. Olive oil = anointing oil → kingship, light, peace (biblically well-established)
2. The olive harvest in Israel occurs in fall, coinciding with Tabernacles / Feast of Ingathering ([Exodus 23:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/23?lang=eng&id=p16#p16))
3. [D&C 116](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/116?lang=eng) identifies Adam-ondi-Ahman as the place where the Ancient of Days will sit
4. [Daniel 7:13–14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/7?lang=eng&id=p13-p14#p13) describes the Son of Man receiving everlasting dominion there
5. Therefore: Adam-ondi-Ahman = the final "pressing" of dispensational oil = the olive harvest = Tabernacles

Each individual step has scriptural support, and the synthesis is internally consistent. The agricultural timing works. The anointing/kingship symbolism works. But no scripture or prophetic authority has *explicitly connected* the olive harvest to Adam-ondi-Ahman. This should be held as an elegant typological reading — one that rewards further study — not as established doctrine.

### Out of Line

Nothing in Phase 1 is clearly out of line with scripture. Philpot's framework builds on real scriptural patterns and genuine agricultural realities of ancient Israel. His claims are either directly supported or are reasonable typological inferences. He does not contradict prophetic authority, nor does he claim personal revelation or prophetic status. His slide 16 disclaimer about calendrical uncertainty is honest and appropriate.

### Missed the Mark

**The Creation / Holy Week / 7000 Years / 7 Seals Grid (slides 35–38)**

These four slides are section headers only — no content is developed in Phase 1. Fitting multiple 7-element sequences (creation days, Holy Week events, millennial periods, seal openings) into a single grid risks pattern-matching over substance. The number 7 *is* prominent in scripture, but the assumption that all "sevens" map onto each other in a single unified timeline needs to be tested element by element, not assumed. This caution will apply more when these slides are developed in later phases.

### Missed Opportunities

**1. D&C 86 — The Lord's Own Wheat/Tares Interpretation**

Philpot cites [Matthew 13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/13?lang=eng) for the wheat-and-tares parable but does not reference [D&C 86](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/86?lang=eng), where the Lord gives an *expanded* Restoration interpretation. This is a significant omission because:

- D&C 86:3 identifies the tares as Babylon, the great whore — providing historical specificity
- D&C 86:4 places us in the timeline: "In the last days, even now while the Lord is beginning to bring forth the word, and the blade is springing up and is yet tender"
- D&C 86:7 *reverses the gathering order* from Matthew 13:30: "Ye shall first gather out the wheat from among the tares." This detail — that the righteous are gathered first — strengthens Philpot's own sequential harvest framework

**2. Joel 3:13 — Sickle and Winepress Together**

[Joel 3:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/joel/3?lang=eng&id=p13#p13): "Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great." This verse places the grain harvest *and* the wine press side by side in a single judgment scene. It both supports the multi-harvest framework and complicates it — Joel presents them as nearly simultaneous rather than sequential. Engaging this verse would make Philpot's argument more robust.

**3. Isaiah 63:1–6 — The Red-Garment Christ**

[Isaiah 63:1–3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/63?lang=eng&id=p1-p3#p1): "Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah?... I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me." This is one of the most vivid Second Coming passages in all scripture and directly connects to the grape/winepress typology. It would powerfully illustrate the "wrath phase" of the harvest framework.

**4. Ruth Gleaning in Boaz's Barley Field**

The book of Ruth — a Gentile convert gleaning in Boaz's *barley field* during the harvest ([Ruth 2:17, 23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ruth/2?lang=eng&id=p17#p17)), then being redeemed by the kinsman-redeemer at the *threshing floor* ([Ruth 3:2–7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ruth/3?lang=eng&id=p2-p7#p2)) — is a beautiful type: the outsider received into covenant through the barley harvest, redeemed by one who has the *right* to redeem. This would strengthen the barley/firstfruits/redemption thread.

**5. D&C 33:3 — "The Eleventh Hour"**

[D&C 33:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/33?lang=eng&id=p3#p3): "The field is white already to harvest; and it is the eleventh hour, and the last time that I shall call laborers into my vineyard." The "eleventh hour" language would reinforce Philpot's urgency about where we stand in the harvest timeline. It explicitly says this is the *last call*.

### Overall Assessment

Phase 1 is the theological foundation for the entire 3-hour presentation, and it is remarkably well-grounded in scripture. Philpot demonstrates genuine familiarity with both Old Testament feast laws and New Testament/Restoration connections. His four-harvest framework (barley → wheat → grapes → olives) is built on real agricultural and liturgical patterns, not speculative numerology.

**Strengths:**
- The barley/firstfruits → Christ's resurrection connection is scripturally airtight
- The wheat/Pentecost linkage is confirmed by Leviticus 23:15–17 (wheat loaves at Pentecost)
- The grain vs. grape distinction in Revelation 14:14–20 provides structural support for a multi-phase harvest
- Adam-ondi-Ahman as a gathering of dispensational keys is supported by D&C 107:53–57, D&C 116, Daniel 7, and general conference teachings
- The Feast of Tabernacles in the millennium is explicitly prophesied in Zechariah 14:16

**Cautions:**
- The 4-harvest table (slide 34) is an *interpretive framework*, not explicit scripture. Each column is inferential to varying degrees — the barley column is the strongest; the olive column is the most creative
- The 3 Nephi 8:5 "fourth day" slide label glosses over a genuine calendrical difficulty
- The creation/Holy Week/7000 years/7 seals grid is introduced but not substantiated — its merit will depend on how it's developed in later phases
- No prophetic authority (apostle, prophet, or church manual) has taught this specific 4-harvest framework as doctrine. It is a plausible, scripturally literate reading — not a revealed timeline

**Recommendation:** This material rewards careful study and reflection. The individual scriptural connections are sound enough to build upon. The overall framework should be held as an illuminating lens for reading scripture rather than as a prophetic map for predicting events. The listener who takes Philpot's slides as *invitations to study* rather than *settled interpretations* will get the most value.

## Step 5: Become

> *"Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection."* — [D&C 130:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130?lang=eng&id=p18#p18)

### Truths to Apply

- **God embeds prophecy in the rhythms of creation.** The agricultural feasts weren't arbitrary — barley, wheat, grapes, and olives each ripen in their season, and God attached his holy days to those seasons. There is a deliberate order to God's work: "to every thing there is a season" ([Ecclesiastes 3:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/eccl/3?lang=eng&id=p1#p1)).
- **Christ is the firstfruits.** The fact that he rose on the exact day of the wave sheaf offering ([Leviticus 23:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/23?lang=eng&id=p11#p11)) — "on the morrow after the sabbath" — is not coincidence. Paul saw it ([1 Corinthians 15:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p20#p20)). The feasts were prophetic blueprints.
- **The Restoration carries harvest language for a reason.** The Lord told Joseph Smith the field was "white already to harvest" ([D&C 4:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4?lang=eng&id=p4#p4)) because we are in the wheat-harvest phase — the gathering of covenant Israel. This isn't decorative metaphor; it's positional awareness.
- **Adam-ondi-Ahman is real and future.** The valley where Adam blessed his posterity ([D&C 107:53](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng&id=p53#p53)) will see a gathering again. Elder Maxwell: "The valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman will ring again — this time with the sounds of dispensational reunion." This is not folklore; it's doctrine.

### Warnings to Heed

- **Hold frameworks loosely.** Philpot's harvest grid is illuminating but interpretive. If we grip it too tightly, we may start reading into scripture what we expected to find rather than what the Spirit reveals. The framework serves scripture; scripture does not serve the framework.
- **Calendrical precision can mislead.** The "fourth day of the first month" question shows that ancient calendar systems don't always reconcile neatly. When a teacher says "this aligns perfectly," check the math carefully. Philpot's slide 16 disclaimer is honest; his slide 13 title is less careful.
- **The urgency is real but the timeline is God's.** "That day and hour knoweth no man" ([Matthew 24:36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/24?lang=eng&id=p36#p36)) stands alongside every sign-watching framework. The duty is to watch and prepare, not to map and predict.
