# Phase 5: Ezekiel's Eagle & the Rebellious House

> Morgan Philpot — *Signs of the Times* (Chandler, AZ, 2025)
> Slides 149–186 | Part I Transcript (~1:04:00–1:24:00)

**Evaluation Focus:** Is Ezekiel 17 legitimately applicable to Restoration history, or is this eisegesis? The Hebrew word study (kə·nā·'an = "land of traffick" = Commerce, IL) is the kind of claim that needs careful verification. How does the "rebellious house" framework map onto the historical realities of Edmunds-Tucker, Official Declaration 1, and Utah statehood?

**Bias Alert:** Ezekiel 17 decodes itself — the prophet explains his own riddle in verses 12–21. Any reading that maps the parable onto a different historical setting must contend with the original, self-interpreting context. At the same time, the chapter header and LDS footnotes acknowledge a last-days dimension in vv. 22–24. Evaluate both the linguistic evidence and the interpretive framework honestly.

## Step 1: Summary

### Main Thesis

Phase 4 ended with the woman (Church) fleeing to the wilderness on "two wings of a great eagle" ([JST Rev 12:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/jst/jst-rev/12?lang=eng&id=p14#p14)). Phase 5 asks: *Where is this eagle in the Old Testament?* Philpot's answer: [Ezekiel 17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/17?lang=eng), a "riddle and parable" about a great eagle with "divers colours" that carries the "highest branch of the cedar" into "a land of traffick" and sets it in "a city of merchants."

Philpot reads Ezekiel 17 as a Restoration prophecy: the eagle's "divers colours" invoke Joseph's "coat of many colours" ([Genesis 37:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/37?lang=eng&id=p3#p3)), connecting the eagle to the Tribe of Joseph. The "highest branch" is Joseph Smith — the "righteous branch" raised up from Joseph's loins ([2 Nephi 3:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p5#p5)). The "land of traffick" is Commerce, Illinois, because the Hebrew word *kə·nā·'an* means both "Canaan" and "land of trade/traffick." The "city of merchants" is Nauvoo (formerly Commerce), confirmed by [D&C 124](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng) header: "the city of Nauvoo, occupying the site of the former village of Commerce, Illinois." The "second great eagle" (v. 7) is the US government. The "east wind" (v. 10) is judgment/famine, connecting to Pharaoh's dream ([Genesis 41:6, 23, 27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/41?lang=eng&id=p6#p6)) and President Hinckley's October 2001 warning.

The latter half of the phase addresses "the rebellious house" (v. 12). Philpot reads this as the US government's persecution of the Saints: Alfred Cumming appointed territorial governor in 1858 ("the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem"), the Edmunds-Tucker Act of 1887, [Official Declaration 1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/od/1?lang=eng) (1890/1893), and Utah statehood in 1896 — all fulfilling the prophecy "that the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up" (v. 14). The Utah Constitution's requirements (polygamy prohibited, public lands disclaimed, schools free from "sectarian control") represent the "broken oaths and covenants" (vv. 15–19) and the forfeiture of the Church's "birthright" — its political sovereignty and hereditary priesthood authority.

### Key Claims

1. **"Divers colours" = Joseph** — Eagle's feathers ([Ezek 17:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/17?lang=eng&id=p3#p3)) → Joseph's "coat of many colours" ([Gen 37:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/37?lang=eng&id=p3#p3)) → Tribe of Joseph (slides 153–154)
2. **"Highest branch" = Joseph Smith** — "A righteous branch unto the house of Israel" ([2 Ne 3:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p5#p5)); "his name shall be called after me" ([2 Ne 3:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p15#p15)) (slides 155–156)
3. **"Land of traffick" = Commerce, IL** — Hebrew *kə·nā·'an* = Canaan = "land of traffick" (slide 158)
4. **"City of merchants" = Nauvoo** — Hebrew *rō·ḵə·lîm* = traders/merchants; D&C 124 header confirms Nauvoo = former Commerce (slides 160, 163)
5. **Moses 6:17 Cainan link** — "Land of Cainan" / "land of promise, which he called after his own son, whom he had named Cainan" supports the Canaan/Commerce connection (slide 159)
6. **Second eagle = US government** — [Ezek 17:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/17?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) (slide 166)
7. **East wind = judgment/famine** — [Gen 41:6, 23, 27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/41?lang=eng&id=p6#p6); Hinckley, Oct 2001 (slides 167–170)
8. **"Rebellious house" = United States** — [Ezek 17:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/17?lang=eng&id=p12#p12); Alfred Cumming 1858 = "king of Babylon" (slides 172–173)
9. **"Kingdom might be base"** — Edmunds-Tucker (1887), OD1 (1890), statehood (1896) (slides 174–183)
10. **Broken oaths = lost birthright** — Utah Constitution Article III; Bible Dictionary "Birthright" (slides 183–185)
11. **Heber C. Kimball memorandum (1862)** — "The Lord God told me Congress would reject the Saints" (slide 176)
12. **Senator Dubois quote** — "Not nearly so much opposed to polygamy as we were to the political domination of the Church" (slide 177)
13. **Wilford Woodruff journal (1887)** — Edmunds-Tucker = "the most unconstitutional Law Ever past By any Republican government on Earth" (slide 178)

## Transcript Review Notes

*Review date: 2026-02-09*

**Phase 5 has the LARGEST gap between slide content and verbal delivery in the entire series.**

The Ezekiel 17 riddle — Hebrew word studies (*kə·nā·'an*, *rō·ḵə·lîm*), Commerce IL = "land of traffick," "divers colours" → Joseph's coat, Moses 6:17 Cainan chain, "rebellious house" framework, Alfred Cumming as "king of Babylon" — is **entirely slide-only**. Not one mention of Ezekiel, Commerce, traffick, highest branch, Cainan, rebellious house, or Cumming appears in any of the three transcripts.

The verbal delivery from ~42:00 to 1:24:00 presents an entirely different argument: a comprehensive **Revelation 13 beast-kingdom identification of the United States**, running verse-by-verse through Rev 13:1–18 with specific historical mappings.

### Verbal Content NOT in Evaluation (Revelation 13 Beast-Kingdom Argument)

The following claims are **verbally developed extensively** (~42:00–1:24:00) but the evaluation does not address them because it focused on the Ezekiel 17 slide content:

**1. US as the Beast of Revelation 13:1 (~42:00–43:00)**
The beast "cannot be the United States" at April 6, 1830 because D&C 98/101 says the Lord raised up the founders. The eagle (pre-1830 US) and the beast from the sea are DIFFERENT entities. The beast emerges after the dragon (modern godless government) co-opts the US. "If you're the devil, what government do you want? [The one that] just made a satanic pact with you just like Cain did by murdering the modern Abel."

**2. Seven Heads = Seven Dispensational Beasts (~1:04:00–1:05:00)**
"Just like there are seven churches in the book of Revelation, one for each dispensation, there are seven beasts, one for each dispensation. The message is not that this beast has seven heads. It is that it is the same head that has always manifested itself." The seventh beast is "perfected" — no longer a small serpent but a dragon with armies, navies, false priests, gold and silver.

**3. Beast Has All Powers of Previous Beasts (~1:05:00–1:06:00)**
"It will have the power of the bear… the lion… the leopard. And implicit in this is the power of the eagle, which Daniel saw in Daniel 7." This last-days beast is "Babylon and the Medes and the Persians and the Greeks and the Romans all combined into one."

**4. Civil War = Deadly Wound Healed (Rev 13:3) (~1:06:00)**
"In the last days, the North will go to war with the South. And it will look like America is wounded to death. And the deadly wound will be healed at the end of that civil war after they murder Abraham Lincoln."

**5. 42 Months from Emancipation Proclamation to Lee's Surrender (Rev 13:5) (~1:06:30)**
"The civil war went on for 42 months. From the date of the emancipation proclamation to the surrender of Lee was 42 months. And it was on like Passover and Rashashana the dates." This is a specific, verifiable date claim that should be checked. (Emancipation Proclamation: Jan 1, 1863; Lee's surrender: April 9, 1865 = ~27 months, not 42. The claim appears incorrect unless a different start date is used.)

**6. America Overcomes the Saints (Rev 13:7) (~1:07:00–1:09:00)**
After proving loyalty to the devil through murdering Joseph, driving out saints, enslaving people, America "will make war with the saints in Utah and will overcome the saints in Utah after the Civil War ends."

**7. 10 Horns = First 10 Post-Lincoln Presidents to Taft (~1:09:38)**
Specific president-by-president mapping: Andrew Johnson (1) through William Howard Taft (10). Taft as first president to visit Utah, accepting the 1907 church declaration of submission.

**8. 1907 Church Declaration (~1:10:00)**
Full verbal reading of the declaration's conditional language: "This affirmation we make to you is predicated… upon the express understanding that politics in the states where our people reside shall be conducted as in other parts of the union." Philpot emphasizes: "the day comes that you don't do this anymore, know that we are loyal to God first."

**9. Two-Horned Beast = Wilson/Harding = Republican/Democrat Control (Rev 13:11) (~1:12:41)**
"The next two presidents will represent the two horns of a lamblike creature… that looks by all appearances to be Christian, but is in fact anything but. And its power will now not be exercised through people, but two horns will control all politics from this point on."

**10. US Power = Nuclear Weapons / "Fire from Heaven" (Rev 13:13) (~1:15:00)**
"Does the United States gain the power to make fire come down from heaven after 1909? Absolutely." "How did we win World War II? We killed a whole bunch of women and children in Hiroshima and Nagasaki with a bomb dropped from the sky."

**11. Image of the Beast = Propaganda / Intelligence Community (Rev 13:14–15) (~1:19:00)**
"The beast has the power to give life to his own image… That's propaganda. That's the intelligence community." Rise of CIA/intelligence post-WWI/WWII.

**12. Mark of the Beast = Financial/Monetary System (Rev 13:16–17) (~1:20:27)**
"It's the control of monetary policy." Nobody can buy or sell without participating in the beast's financial system. Connected to Hamilton/central banking history (~49:00) and Joseph Smith's independence mandate.

**13. Daniel 2 Toes = Specific Presidents (~43:00–45:00)**
Washington through 10th toe → March 11, 1844 (kingdom of God organized). Joseph Smith born at 3rd toe, First Vision at 4th, gold plates at 5th/6th, church at 7th, kingdom at 10th.

**14. Cain/Abel Temple Symbolism = Government Authority (~45:00–46:00)**
"Any government which sets itself up in opposition to the government of God is… the enemy of God. We learn this in the temple." Cain kills with a stone (apocryphal) = usurping governmental authority = execution by law. "The little serpent… what has the little snake become? A huge dragon in the last days."

**15. Alexander Hamilton / Central Banking Narrative (~49:00–53:00)**
First Bank → War of 1812 → Second Bank → Andrew Jackson's veto and graft → depression → South + Mormons as commodity-based economies → systemic targeting. "We took banking out of… United States Christian control and we dispersed it out to the states."

**16. "Twin Relics of Barbarism" (~53:46)**
The 1856 Republican Party platform phrase linking slavery and polygamy as "the two most evil" things to eliminate. Historically accurate attribution.

**17. "Blood Oath Between the Devil and the United States" (~1:03:00)**
"If I'm wrong, how am I wrong? We enslaved people and we murdered the modern Abel. So America murdered the modern Abel. And what happened to the people who murdered Joseph Smith? Nothing."

**18. D&C 87 (~1:08:00)**
"The Lord says he'll bring a full end of all nations." Already noted as a Missed Opportunity in Phase 4 evaluation — but Philpot does verbally reference it here.

### Assessment of the Gap

The evaluation's analysis of Ezekiel 17 remains valid as a critique of the SLIDE content — the eisegesis point, the Hebrew word study issues (*riqmah* vs. *ketonet passim*), and the OD1 mischaracterization are all correctly argued. But the audience in Chandler never heard the Ezekiel 17 argument verbally. What they heard was a comprehensive Revelation 13 reading that is theologically more ambitious and historically more detailed than the slide-based Ezekiel 17 material.

The Revelation 13 argument deserves its own evaluation. Several claims are verifiable:
- The 42-months calculation appears mathematically wrong (Jan 1863 to Apr 1865 ≈ 27 months)
- The nuclear weapons / "fire from heaven" reading has been made by other commentators historically
- The beast = government (not devil) distinction is an important hermeneutic clarification
- The seven-heads = seven-dispensations reading is creative but novel

The evaluation's overlap with verbal content is limited to: Edmunds-Tucker criminalizing brethren, Utah statehood equal-footing clause violation, birthright forfeiture (land, priesthood, religious freedom, posterity), and the overall assessment that the US persecuted the Saints. These are correctly captured.

## Step 3: Evaluation

### In Line

**1. The Hebrew Word Study Is Real — Bible Dictionary Confirms It**

Philpot's central linguistic claim — that Hebrew *kə·nā·'an* means both "Canaan" and "land of traffick/trade" — is not made up. The Church's own Bible Dictionary confirms it:

> "As the Phoenicians were great traders, *Canaanite* came to denote merchant ([Isa. 23:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/23?lang=eng); [Ezek. 17:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/17?lang=eng); [Hosea 12:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hosea/12?lang=eng&id=p7#p7))." — [Bible Dictionary: Canaan](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bd/canaan?lang=eng)

Note that the Bible Dictionary *specifically cites Ezekiel 17:4* — the very verse Philpot builds on. Additionally, the Ezekiel 17:4 footnote in the LDS scriptures reads: "**traffick** — HEB trade or traders." The linguistic connection between "Canaan," "merchant," and "land of traffick" is genuine and acknowledged in LDS scholarship.

**2. D&C 124 Confirms Nauvoo = Former Commerce, Illinois**

This is simple and factual:

> "In 1841, when this revelation was given, the city of Nauvoo, **occupying the site of the former village of Commerce, Illinois**, had been built up by the Saints, and here the headquarters of the Church had been established." — [D&C 124 header](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng)

The town was literally called "Commerce" when the Saints first arrived. Joseph Smith renamed it "Nauvoo." This is not interpretation — it's history. The connection "city of traffick → Commerce, IL" is a genuine English-Hebrew coincidence that any reader can verify.

**3. Official Declaration 1 Quotes Are Accurate and Canonical**

Philpot quotes Wilford Woodruff from the Salt Lake Temple dedication (April 1893), and these words appear verbatim in the canonized [Official Declaration 1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/od/1?lang=eng):

> "The Lord showed me by vision and revelation exactly what would take place if we did not stop this practice."

> "The Son of God felt disposed to have that thing presented to the Church and to the world for purposes in his own mind. The Lord had decreed the establishment of Zion. He had decreed the finishing of this temple. He had decreed that the salvation of the living and the dead should be given in these valleys of the mountains. And Almighty God decreed that the Devil should not thwart it."

These are the words of a prophet describing a divine directive. They are part of the scriptural canon. Philpot uses them accurately.

**4. Ezekiel 17:22–24 IS About the Last Days**

The LDS chapter header acknowledges this: "Yet the Lord will bring forth **in the last days** a goodly tree from the cedars of Lebanon." And the footnotes confirm it — [Ezekiel 17:22a](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/17?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) cross-references [Omni 1:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/omni/1?lang=eng&id=p15#p15), [Mosiah 25:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/25?lang=eng&id=p2#p2), and [Helaman 8:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/8?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) — all Book of Mormon passages about peoples taken from Jerusalem and transplanted to the Americas. Footnote 22b connects to [Jacob 5:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&id=p24#p24), the allegory of the olive tree.

The Lord's own coda to the riddle (vv. 22–24) is about replanting branches in a new land — and the LDS footnotes explicitly connect this to the Book of Mormon peoples. There IS a legitimate Restoration dimension to Ezekiel 17. The question is *how much* of the chapter it applies to.

**5. The Historical Events Are Real**

The Edmunds-Tucker Act (1887), the Manifesto (1890), the Salt Lake Temple dedication (1893), and Utah statehood with its constitutional conditions (1896) are well-documented history. Alfred Cumming's appointment as territorial governor (1858) during the Utah War is historical fact. Woodruff's journal entry about Edmunds-Tucker being "the most unconstitutional Law Ever past By any Republican government on Earth" is from a historical source Philpot correctly identifies. The Dubois quote about political domination vs. polygamy is attested. These are not fabricated — Philpot has done genuine historical research.

**6. Hinckley's Pharaoh's Dream Reference Is Accurate**

President Hinckley did say:

> "I cannot forget the great lesson of Pharaoh's dream of the fat and lean kine and of the full and withered stalks of corn. … Now, I do not wish to be an alarmist." — [The Times in Which We Live](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2001/10/the-times-in-which-we-live?lang=eng), October 2001

The quote is real and correctly attributed. However, context matters — see "Missed the Mark" below.

---

### Nuanced

**1. The "Highest Branch" = Joseph Smith (via 2 Nephi 3)**

Philpot connects Ezekiel 17:3 ("took the highest branch of the cedar") to [2 Nephi 3:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p5#p5): "Out of the fruit of his loins the Lord God would raise up a righteous *branch* unto the house of Israel." The word "branch" appears in both passages, and 2 Nephi 3:15 explicitly identifies this figure as "Joseph" — named after his father.

**What supports this:** The typological resonance is real. 2 Nephi 3 is a prophecy about Joseph Smith ("a choice seer... out of the fruit of thy loins," v. 7). The "branch" language in both passages invites comparison. And Ezekiel 17:22 — where the Lord says "I will also take of the highest branch" — has LDS footnotes pointing to Book of Mormon passages about peoples transplanted to the Americas, establishing that the Church's own editors saw a New World dimension in the text.

**What complicates this:** The "highest branch" in Ezekiel 17's original context is King Jehoiachin (2 Kings 24:11–12), carried to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar. The footnote at v. 12b makes this identification explicit. Verbs 22–24's "highest branch" is the Lord's *counterpoint* — taking a "tender one" and replanting it. The standard reading of this tender branch is messianic (cf. Isaiah 11:1, "a rod out of the stem of Jesse"). The 2 Nephi 3 "branch" is a *seer*, not a king or cedar — the metaphorical register is different.

Also, the Hebrew word for "divers colours" in Ezekiel 17:3 (רִקְמָה, *riqmah* — "embroidery, variegated work") is a completely different word from Genesis 37:3's "many colours" (כְּתֹנֶת פַּסִּים, *ketonet passim* — likely "long-sleeved garment" or "ornamental tunic"). The KJV renders both as color-related words, but the Hebrew is distinct. The "divers colours" → "coat of many colours" connection works in English but not in the original language.

**Assessment:** The typological connection is interesting but rests on English translation coincidences more than Hebrew lexical links. The footnotes *do* connect Ezekiel 17:22 to the Book of Mormon — but to Mulek and the people of Zarahemla, not to Joseph Smith.

**2. Moses 6:17 — The Cainan/Canaan/Commerce Chain**

[Moses 6:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p17#p17): "Enos and the residue of the people of God came out from the land, which was called Shulon, and dwelt in a land of promise, which he called after his own son, whom he had named Cainan."

Philpot uses this to create a typological chain: Cainan → Canaan → land of promise → Commerce, Illinois. The phonetic similarity is provocative.

**What complicates this:** Biblical Cainan (קֵינָן, *Qeynan*, son of Enos, Moses 6:17) and Canaan (כְּנַעַן, *Kəna'an*, son of Ham, Genesis 9:18) are different Hebrew names, different persons, different lineages. The KJV English makes them look similar; the Hebrew distinguishes them. The Cainan of Moses 6 is a righteous patriarch in the line of Seth. The Canaan of Genesis 9 is the grandson of Noah who was cursed. Building a typological chain on phonetic similarity in English translation while the Hebrew roots diverge is the same pattern as the "divers colours" connection — suggestive in English, unsupported in Hebrew.

**3. The "Rebellious House" Reading — Historically Grounded but Interpretively Loaded**

Philpot's historical sequence is real: the US government did persecute the Saints through legislation, judicial action, and military force between 1858 and 1896. The Edmunds-Tucker Act (1887) did disincorporate the Church, escheated its property, and abolished female suffrage in Utah. These are not disputed facts.

But calling the United States "the rebellious house" reverses Ezekiel's framework. In the original text, the "rebellious house" is *Israel* — it's the covenant people who rebel, not the oppressing power. Ezekiel says to "the rebellious house" (v. 12): "Know ye not what these things mean?" The rebellious house is the audience receiving the rebuke. If we apply this to the Restoration, the "rebellious house" would be the *Saints* who are failing to understand the prophetic patterns — not the US government.

This ambiguity actually suggests something more interesting than what Philpot offers. See "Missed Opportunities" below.

### Out of Line

**1. Applying Ezekiel 17:1–21 Wholesale to Restoration History Is Eisegesis**

This is the fundamental problem with Phase 5. Ezekiel 17 is a self-interpreting text — one of the rare cases where a prophet explains his own riddle in the same chapter:

- **v. 3, first eagle:** "The king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem, and hath taken the king thereof" (v. 12) — Nebuchadnezzar took King Jehoiachin. The footnote at 12b cross-references [2 Kings 24:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/24?lang=eng&id=p11#p11).
- **v. 4, "highest branch":** The king carried to Babylon (Jehoiachin/Zedekiah). Footnote 4a: "TG Israel, Scattering of."
- **v. 7, second eagle:** Pharaoh of Egypt, to whom Zedekiah appealed (v. 15). Footnote 17a: "[Jer. 44:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/44?lang=eng)."
- **v. 13, covenant and oath:** Nebuchadnezzar's vassal agreement with Zedekiah. Footnote 13b: "[2 Chr. 36:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/36?lang=eng)."
- **v. 14, "kingdom might be base":** Nebuchadnezzar's intent that Judah remain subordinate and not revolt.
- **vv. 15–19, broken covenant:** Zedekiah broke his oath of loyalty to Babylon by seeking Egyptian alliance. "Shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?" (v. 15). God himself adopts the broken oath as *his own*: "Mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken" (v. 19).

The text tells you what the riddle means. Every element is identified. To take this self-interpreted parable and reapply it to a completely different historical context — Restoration-era Illinois and 19th-century US politics — while ignoring the author's own explanation requires overpowering the text rather than reading it.

Compare this with JST Revelation 12, where Philpot's Phase 4 reading was *supported* by the text — the JST explicitly names the woman as "the church of God" and adds "in the likeness of things on the earth." Ezekiel 17 does the opposite: it provides its own decryption key that points to Babylon, Judah, and Egypt, not to the Restoration.

**2. Alfred Cumming as "King of Babylon"**

Philpot reads Ezekiel 17:12 — "the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem" — as Alfred Cumming arriving in Utah in 1858 as a US-appointed territorial governor.

This is typological assertion, not exegesis. The text identifies the king of Babylon as *Nebuchadnezzar*, who conquered Jerusalem in 597 BC. The footnote at 12b points to [2 Kings 24:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/24?lang=eng&id=p11#p11), which narrates the actual historical Babylonian siege. Cumming was a civilian governor who arrived during the Utah War — a military expedition that never resulted in battle. He governed a territory that remained part of the United States. This is not Babylon conquering Jerusalem; it is a federal government asserting authority over its own territory.

**3. The "Broken Oaths" Framework Mischaracterizes OD1**

Philpot reads Ezekiel 17:15–19 ("Shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?... Mine oath that he hath despised") to frame the statehood concessions as broken covenants. Combined with the Bible Dictionary "Birthright" entry, this creates the impression that the Church forfeited a divine inheritance.

But [Official Declaration 1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/od/1?lang=eng) tells a different story. Woodruff did not describe his decision as breaking a covenant — he described it as *following revelation to preserve covenant functionality*:

> "I should have let all the temples go out of our hands; I should have gone to prison myself, and let every other man go there, **had not the God of heaven commanded me to do what I did do**; and when the hour came that I was commanded to do that, it was all clear to me. I went before the Lord, and I wrote what the Lord told me to write."

And:

> "The Lord had decreed the establishment of Zion. He had decreed the finishing of this temple. He had decreed that the salvation of the living and the dead should be given in these valleys of the mountains. **And Almighty God decreed that the Devil should not thwart it.**"

This is not the language of defeat, capitulation, or broken oaths. It is the language of a prophet receiving revelation to prioritize the most essential covenant functions — temples, ordinances for the living and the dead — over a particular practice. Reading this through the lens of "the kingdom might be base" flattens the profound spiritual reasoning Woodruff describes into a narrative of loss.

### Missed the Mark

**1. Ezekiel 17:22–24 Points to Scattered Israel and Mulek, Not Joseph Smith**

The chapter header says the Lord will bring forth "in the last days a goodly tree from the cedars of Lebanon" — acknowledging a future fulfillment. But the LDS footnotes at v. 22a point to [Omni 1:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/omni/1?lang=eng&id=p15#p15), [Mosiah 25:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/25?lang=eng&id=p2#p2), and [Helaman 8:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/8?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) — all references to the people of Mulek/Zarahemla who came from Jerusalem to the Americas. The Church's own editors connected the "highest branch" taken from the cedar and transplanted to the Book of Mormon, not to Joseph Smith.

This is actually a stronger Restoration connection than what Philpot offers. The LDS footnote system *does* see Ezekiel 17:22 as pointing to the New World — but the connection is to the scattering and gathering of Israel (branches carried to distant lands), not to an individual prophet or the city of Commerce, Illinois. Philpot could have used the footnotes to support a more defensible argument.

**2. Hinckley's Pharaoh Reference Is About Economic Prudence, Not Ezekiel's East Wind**

Philpot cites President Hinckley's October 2001 reference to Pharaoh's dream (slide 170) immediately after discussing Ezekiel 17:10's "east wind" and Genesis 41's "seven ears blasted with the east wind." The juxtaposition implies Hinckley was validating the Ezekiel-Genesis-east-wind interpretive chain.

Reading the [full talk](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2001/10/the-times-in-which-we-live?lang=eng) reveals a completely different context. Hinckley was speaking after the September 11 attacks about *economic preparedness and self-reliance*:

> "Occasions of this kind pull us up sharply to a realization that life is fragile, peace is fragile, civilization itself is fragile. The economy is particularly vulnerable. We have been counseled again and again concerning self-reliance, concerning debt, concerning thrift."

> "I cannot forget the great lesson of Pharaoh's dream of the fat and lean kine and of the full and withered stalks of corn."

Hinckley used Pharaoh's dream as a lesson about *storing food and getting out of debt* in troubled times — not as a prophetic commentary on Ezekiel 17's eagle parable. Placing the Hinckley quote alongside the Ezekiel passage without disclosing the post-9/11 economic context creates a false impression that a modern prophet was endorsing the interpretive framework.

**3. Who Is Really the "Rebellious House"?**

In Ezekiel 17:12, God tells Ezekiel: "Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean?" In the original context, the "rebellious house" is *Israel* — the covenant people who refuse to see what God is doing. Ezekiel doesn't rebuke Babylon for being Babylon; he rebukes Israel for being blind.

Philpot applies "rebellious house" to the US government. But if the typology holds, the "rebellious house" would be the *covenant people* — the Saints who cannot read the signs or understand the prophetic pattern. This reading would actually *strengthen* Philpot's larger thesis (that modern Saints don't recognize how scripture applies to their own history). He misidentifies who the rebuke is for.

---

### Missed Opportunities

**1. Jacob 5 — The Lord's Own "Branch" Allegory**

Ezekiel 17's footnotes at v. 8a and v. 22b both cross-reference [Jacob 5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng) — Zenos's allegory of the olive tree. This is the Book of Mormon's own extended metaphor about branches being taken from the mother tree and planted in distant corners of the vineyard. Jacob 5 deals with the same themes as Ezekiel 17 (scattering, branches, transplanting, the Lord of the vineyard tending his trees), but it does so within the Restoration canon and with far more detail. If Philpot wanted a "branch" framework for understanding how God transplants covenant peoples to new lands, Jacob 5 was right there — and the Ezekiel 17 footnotes point to it.

**2. D&C 101:80 — The Lord's Own View of the US Government**

> "I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose." — [D&C 101:80](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101?lang=eng&id=p80#p80)

Philpot's framework positions the US government as the "second great eagle" that oppresses and withers the vine. But the Lord himself describes raising up the Constitution through "wise men" for *his* purposes. The relationship between the Church and the US government is far more complex than oppressor/oppressed. [D&C 98:5–6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98?lang=eng&id=p5-p6#p5) adds: "That law of the land which is *constitutional*, supporting that principle of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges, belongs to all mankind, and is justifiable before me." A complete analysis would grapple with this tension rather than resolving it one-dimensionally.

**3. The Actual Theology of OD1 — Strategic Obedience, Not Defeat**

Woodruff's reasoning in OD1 is one of the most important leadership moments in Restoration history. He saw "exactly what would come to pass" — temples lost, ordinances stopped, leaders imprisoned, the work halted. He *chose* to preserve the broader covenant infrastructure (temples, baptism for the dead, the sealing ordinances for the living and dead) at the cost of one particular practice. This is not "the kingdom being made base" — it is the Lord ensuring that "the Devil should not thwart" his work.

A richer reading would compare Woodruff's decision with other scriptural moments of strategic withdrawal: the Saints leaving Missouri after the extermination order, Nephi fleeing from Laman and Lemuel into the wilderness, Israel accepting terms from God at Sinai. In each case, covenant functionality was preserved even when external conditions contracted. The *real* story is more theologically interesting than the "broken oaths" frame suggests.

**4. D&C 98 and D&C 101 — The Lord's Instructions on Law**

[D&C 98:4–6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98?lang=eng&id=p4-p6#p4) gives the Lord's own instructions on obeying constitutional law. [D&C 101:77–80](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101?lang=eng&id=p77-p80#p77) explains that the Constitution was established for "the rights and protection of all flesh." These sections acknowledge that governments can be corrupt (D&C 98:10: "when the wicked rule the people mourn") while also affirming that constitutional government serves divine purposes. This nuance is entirely absent from Philpot's presentation, which treats the government as a purely adversarial force.

---

### Overall Assessment

Phase 5 is the most methodologically strained section of the series so far.

**What works:** The Hebrew word study is genuine — the Bible Dictionary confirms that "Canaanite" means "merchant" and cites Ezekiel 17:4 specifically. The D&C 124 confirmation that Nauvoo was formerly Commerce, Illinois is factual. The historical research on Edmunds-Tucker, OD1, and Utah statehood conditions is solid. And the Ezekiel 17:22–24 footnotes connecting to the Book of Mormon show that LDS scholarship *does* see a Restoration-era dimension in the chapter's concluding verses.

**What doesn't work:** The fundamental problem is that Ezekiel 17:1–21 is a self-interpreting text. Ezekiel explains his own riddle: the first eagle is Babylon, the highest branch is Jehoiachin, the second eagle is Egypt, the vine is Zedekiah, the broken covenant is Zedekiah's rebellion against Babylonian suzerainty. The text provides its own decoder ring. To override this with a Restoration-era reinterpretation — while leaving the prophet's own explanation unaddressed — is eisegesis, not exegesis.

The "divers colours" → Joseph's coat connection looks compelling in English but fails in Hebrew (different words: *riqmah* vs. *ketonet passim*). The Moses 6:17 Cainan → Canaan link conflates two different Hebrew names and lineages. Alfred Cumming as "king of Babylon" is pure assertion. And treating OD1 as "the kingdom made base" contradicts the canonical account, which describes revelation-driven strategic obedience to preserve covenant ordinances.

**The persistent pattern continues:** Philpot's *historical research* is serious — he reads primary sources, checks Hebrew words, and documents real events. But his *interpretive method* consistently overpowers texts rather than reading them on their own terms. When a passage has a clear original meaning (Ezekiel explaining his own riddle), that meaning should be engaged before being expanded. The strongest parts of Ezekiel 17 for Philpot's case are the parts he underuses — the footnote-supported vv. 22–24 and the Jacob 5 connections — while the weakest parts are the ones he centerpieces (vv. 1–21 remapped to 19th-century Illinois).

## Step 4: Become

### Truths to Carry

1. **The Bible Dictionary "Canaan" entry is a gem.** "Canaanite came to denote merchant" — this single sentence, with its three scripture cross-references including Ezekiel 17:4, opens a window into how Hebrew words carry layered meanings across the Old Testament. I should pay more attention to the Bible Dictionary as a study tool for understanding Hebrew semantic ranges.

2. **Ezekiel 17:22–24 and the Book of Mormon footnotes.** The LDS footnote system connects the "highest branch" and "tender one" to Omni 1:15, Mosiah 25:2, and Helaman 8:21 — the Mulek narrative. This means the Church's own editors saw Ezekiel 17's concluding prophecy as pointing to peoples transplanted from Jerusalem to the Americas. That's a connection I've never noticed before, and it deserves its own study session.

3. **Official Declaration 1 is revelation-driven.** Woodruff's words are canonized for a reason: "I should have gone to prison myself, had not the God of heaven commanded me." The decision to end plural marriage was not political capitulation — it was a prophet receiving and obeying specific revelation to preserve the covenant infrastructure (temples, ordinances for the living and dead). The story is more theologically rich than any "defeat" narrative suggests.

### Warnings to Heed

1. **Self-interpreting texts resist reinterpretation.** When a prophet explains his own riddle in the same chapter, that explanation should be the starting point for any further reading — not something to bypass. Ezekiel 17:12–21 tells you who the eagle is, who the branch is, and what the broken covenant means. Respect the author's own words before building alternative frameworks.

2. **English translation coincidences are not Hebrew connections.** "Divers colours" (Ezekiel 17:3) and "coat of many colours" (Genesis 37:3) look connected in the KJV, but the underlying Hebrew words are different. Similarly, "Cainan" (Moses 6:17) and "Canaan" (Genesis 9:18) are phonetically similar in English but etymologically distinct in Hebrew. Always ask: *Does this connection exist in the original language, or only in translation?*

3. **Context protects against proof-texting.** President Hinckley's Pharaoh's dream reference was about economic preparedness after 9/11, not about Ezekiel's eagle. When a prophetic quote is placed alongside scriptures without noting its original context, the juxtaposition creates a false impression of endorsement. Always read the source.

### Personal Commitments

1. **Study Ezekiel 17:22–24 with the footnotes.** Follow Omni 1:15, Mosiah 25:2, Helaman 8:21, and Jacob 5:24. Trace the "transplanted branch" theme through the Book of Mormon. This is a legitimate line of study that the Ezekiel text and the LDS footnotes both invite.

2. **Read Official Declaration 1 as a standalone study.** Woodruff's three addresses deserve careful study — not just as historical context for polygamy, but as a case study in prophetic decision-making under pressure. The theological reasoning is sophisticated: preserve the things that matter most (temples, ordinances, prophets at liberty) even at real cost.

3. **Learn more about Hebrew word studies.** The Bible Dictionary's Canaan entry showed me how a Hebrew word can carry cultural and commercial connotations that the English translation flattens. I want to build a practice of checking Hebrew meanings for key Old Testament passages, using the Bible Dictionary and the KJV footnotes as entry points.
