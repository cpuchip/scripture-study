# Phase 6: Esdras, Daniel & the Appointed Times

> Morgan Philpot — *Signs of the Times* (Chandler, AZ, 2025)
> Slides 187–228 | Part II Transcript (~0:00–49:00)

**Evaluation Focus:** Does D&C 91 actually support the way Philpot uses 2 Esdras, or does it caution more than endorse? Is the Hebrew word study (mō·w·'ă·ḏîm = feasts = appointed times) accurate? The astronomical claims about April 5–6, 2000 are verifiable — are they correct?

**Bias Alert:** 2 Esdras / Ezra's Eagle is the section most likely to trigger "fringe" classification in my training data. D&C 91 is the Latter-day Saint standard for evaluating Apocryphal material. I should use D&C 91, not academic consensus, as my primary framework — while being honest about what that framework actually says.

## Step 1: Summary

### Main Thesis

Phase 6 covers two interlocking themes. The first is Philpot's use of 2 Esdras 11 (Ezra's Eagle) as a prophetic text mapping to American politics, introduced through the D&C 91 framework for evaluating Apocryphal material. The second is a broader theological argument about "appointed times" — that the heavenly bodies were created to mark God's prophetic calendar ([Genesis 1:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/1?lang=eng&id=p14#p14)), that the Hebrew feasts of [Leviticus 23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/23?lang=eng) are these appointed times, and that the April 6, 2000 dedication of the Palmyra Temple was accompanied by astronomical signs fulfilling this pattern — a "sign of the coming of the Son of Man" paralleling the Nephites' sign at Christ's birth ([3 Nephi 1:15–21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p15-p21#p15)).

The two themes connect through Moroni's scripture recitation to Joseph Smith ([JSH 1:36–41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=p36-p41#p36)), particularly Joel 2:28–32 — which Moroni said "was not yet fulfilled, but was soon to be" and which President Hinckley declared fulfilled in [October 2001](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2001/10/living-in-the-fulness-of-times?lang=eng): "The vision of Joel has been fulfilled."

### Key Claims

**Esdras & Daniel:**
1. **D&C 91 permits reading 2 Esdras** — "there are many things contained therein that are true" and the Bible Dictionary lists 2 Esdras among books "of special value" (slides 187–188)
2. **2 Esdras describes the fourth beast of Daniel 7 as an eagle** — Ezra saw what Daniel was told he would not receive interpretation for (transcript ~8:30)
3. **The eagle's three heads = one government with three branches** — the center head is the executive/judicial/legislative power; the two side heads are the Republican and Democrat parties (transcript ~9:00)
4. **Eagle feathers map to US presidents** — equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats from Herbert Hoover to George W. Bush; the "11th guy" attempts to create a world order (transcript ~9:30)
5. **Six "contrary feathers" = tail feathers** — oppositional political figures; the first is "the first feather and the second feather and the last feather" (transcript ~10:30)
6. **Center head "dies in its bed"** = the Biden administration — "the American government died under Joe Biden because Joe Biden clearly had dementia" (transcript ~14:00)

**Moroni's Recitation & Joel:**
7. **Moroni quoted Joel 2:28–32** to Joseph Smith, saying it "was not yet fulfilled, but was soon to be" ([JSH 1:41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=p41#p41)) (slides 189–193)
8. **President Hinckley declared Joel's vision fulfilled** in October 2001 (slide 194)
9. **Hinckley compared Gadianton robbers to modern terrorism** in the same conference — "We see the same thing in the present situation" (slide 195)

**Appointed Times:**
10. **Hebrew mō·w·'ă·ḏîm = "appointed times"** — the word translated "seasons" in [Genesis 1:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/1?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) is the same root as "feasts" in [Leviticus 23:2, 4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/23?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) — the heavenly bodies mark God's prophetic calendar, not mere meteorological seasons (slides 202–206)
11. **D&C 88:42–49 confirms heavenly bodies move in "times and their seasons"** — they are kingdoms governed by law, and "he who came unto his own was not comprehended" (slides 207–209)
12. **Howard W. Hunter = Samuel the Lamanite** — first "non-covenant-birth" prophet, served 9 months (1994), coined "the calamities foretold by the ancient prophets" which Hinckley placed in the Family Proclamation (transcript ~36:00)
13. **Six years after Hunter (1994) → sign in 2000** — parallels Samuel's prophecy of a sign in five years ([Helaman 14:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14?lang=eng&id=p2#p2)) (transcript ~38:00)
14. **Palmyra Temple dedicated April 6, 2000** — 170 years from Church organization, 180 years from First Vision, 1 Nisan 5760 in the Hebrew calendar (slides 215–217)
15. **All-planet alignment at Palmyra on April 5, 2000** — Philpot claims all seven planetary bodies were visible in the sky at the Palmyra Temple the night before the dedication, with an aurora borealis and all 12 zodiac constellations visible (slides 218–227, transcript ~43:00)
16. **Psalms 19:4–5** — "In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber" — the sign of the coming of the Son of Man (slide 228)

**Book of Mormon Timeline (1909 = 91 BC):**
17. **Joseph F. Smith = modern Alma the Younger** — transitioned the Church from "theocracy" to "reign of judges" in 1909, paralleling Alma's transition from kingship to judges (transcript ~21:00)
18. **Year-by-year mapping** — Nephite events from the reign of judges match US events starting from 1909: McCarthy era = Gadianton introduction, Watergate = Gadiantons obtain "sole management," Trump 2017 = Lachoneus (transcript ~30:00–65:00)
19. **9/11 = Gadianton murders "in the second year"** after seeing the sign (transcript ~52:00)
20. **2028 election = 29th year** — the Book of Mormon predicts a contentious election cycle (transcript ~62:00)

## Step 3: Evaluation

### In Line

**1. The Hebrew mō·w·'ă·ḏîm word study is linguistically sound.**

This is the strongest element in Phase 6. The Hebrew word מועדים (*mô·w·'ă·ḏîm*) in [Genesis 1:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/1?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) — translated "seasons" in the KJV — is the same root (יעד *yā·'aḏ*, to appoint) as the word translated "feasts" in [Leviticus 23:2, 4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/23?lang=eng&id=p2#p2). The word means "appointed times," not meteorological seasons. This is standard Hebrew scholarship, not controversial. The KJV's translation choice obscures a real linguistic connection that Philpot correctly identifies.

[D&C 88:42](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p42#p42) — "he hath given a law unto all things, by which they move in their *times* and their *seasons*" — aligns with this concept: the heavenly bodies operate on divinely appointed schedules.

**2. Moroni's scripture recitation is canonical and correctly cited.**

[JSH 1:36–41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=p36-p41#p36) records Moroni quoting Malachi 3–4 (modified), Isaiah 11, Acts 3:22–23, and Joel 2:28–last. Moroni said Joel's vision "was not yet fulfilled, but was soon to be" (v. 41). This is foundational Restoration scripture.

**3. President Hinckley's declaration that Joel's vision is fulfilled is verified.**

In [October 2001](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2001/10/living-in-the-fulness-of-times?lang=eng), President Hinckley quoted Joel 2:28–32 in full and declared: "The vision of Joel has been fulfilled." He placed this in the context of the Restoration as "the fulness of times" — scientific discovery, priesthood restoration, and the cascade of enlightenment since the First Vision. Philpot's citation is accurate.

**4. Hinckley's comparison of Gadianton robbers to modern terrorism is verified.**

In ["The Times in Which We Live"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2001/10/the-times-in-which-we-live?lang=eng), Hinckley said: "We of this Church know something of such groups. The Book of Mormon speaks of the Gadianton robbers... We see the same thing in the present situation." Philpot quotes this accurately.

**5. D&C 91 cited correctly as framework.**

Philpot cites [D&C 91](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/91?lang=eng) as the Latter-day Saint standard for approaching the Apocrypha. His summary — "there's some good things, there's some bad things, and use the spirit to figure it out" — paraphrases the section honestly.

**6. The Bible Dictionary lists 2 Esdras among books "of special value."**

The [BD Apocrypha](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bd/apocrypha?lang=eng) entry says: "Among these books the following are of special value" and lists 2 Esdras, noting that "the references to the Messiah (7:28–29; 12:32; 13:32, 37, 52) deserve special notice." Philpot paraphrases this as "the brethren put in the Bible dictionary that second Esdris is of particular importance to us" — close but not exact. The BD says "of special value" and highlights the *Messianic* passages, not the eagle vision specifically.

**7. Ether 8:22–25 and the secret combinations warning are canonical.**

Moroni's warning to the Gentiles — "when ye shall see these things come among you that ye shall awake to a sense of your awful situation, because of this secret combination which shall be among you" ([Ether 8:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p24#p24)) — is a direct prophetic warning about the reader's time. The application to modern institutions seeking "power and gain" (v. 23) is a traditional Latter-day Saint reading found in many conference talks.

**8. April 6, 2000 = 1 Nisan 5760 — verified.**

April 6, 2000 in the Gregorian calendar corresponds to 1 Nisan 5760 in the Hebrew calendar — the first day of the first month of the biblical year. The Palmyra Temple was dedicated on a date with genuine Hebrew calendar significance.

**9. April 6, 2000 = 170 years from Church organization — verified.**

The Church was organized April 6, 1830. The Palmyra Temple was dedicated exactly 170 years later. President Hinckley noted the significance of this date in the dedication context.

### Nuanced

**1. D&C 91 permits reading 2 Esdras but doesn't validate any particular interpretation.**

D&C 91 is six verses, and its message is carefully balanced:
- "many things contained therein that are true" (v. 1)
- "mostly translated correctly" (v. 1)
- "many things contained therein that are not true, which are interpolations by the hands of men" (v. 2)
- "it is not needful that the Apocrypha should be translated" (v. 3) — said *twice* (vv. 3, 6)
- "whoso is enlightened by the Spirit shall obtain benefit therefrom" (v. 5)
- "whoso receiveth not by the Spirit, cannot be benefited" (v. 6)

Philpot treats D&C 91 as opening a door. It does — but the door opens onto a room filled with both truth and interpolation, where only Spirit-led discernment can distinguish between them. The revelation's repeated emphasis that translation is "not needful" suggests the Lord considered the signal-to-noise ratio problematic enough to warn readers. Using D&C 91 to justify building detailed political timelines from 2 Esdras goes beyond what the revelation envisions.

**2. The "appointed times" concept bridges real linguistics and speculative prophecy.**

The Hebrew connection between Genesis 1:14 and Leviticus 23 is real. But Philpot uses this to argue that specific astronomical events ARE the prophetic appointed times — that the planetary positions on April 5–6, 2000 constitute a "sign of the coming of the Son of Man." This is a large interpretive leap from a sound linguistic observation to an astronomical-prophetic claim.

[D&C 88:42–49](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p42-p49#p42) does teach that heavenly bodies move in "times and their seasons" and are "kingdoms" — but the passage's conclusion is about *comprehending God*, not about reading political prophecy in the stars: "the day shall come when you shall comprehend even God, being quickened in him and by him" (v. 49).

**3. Hinckley's Gadianton comparison is broader than Philpot frames it.**

President Hinckley compared terrorist organizations *generally* to the Gadianton pattern of secret combinations seeking to destroy society. Philpot asks: "What did 9/11 have to do with taking down the church?" and interprets Hinckley as saying 9/11 specifically targeted the Church. But Hinckley's actual statement is about institutional evil patterns repeating across history — "We see the same *thing* in the present situation" — not about the Church being the specific target of the September 11 attacks. The comparison is to the *pattern*, not the *target*.

**4. The planetary grouping on April 5–6, 2000 was real but overstated.**

Multiple sources confirm a notable planetary grouping was visible from Palmyra on April 5–6, 2000: Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars were grouped low in the western sky after sunset, with the Moon nearby and Venus visible. NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day for April 6, 2000 featured this grouping.

However, Philpot claims "all of the planets of the Maserote" were aligned that night — a seven-planet alignment. The full alignment of all five naked-eye planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) plus Moon and Sun was actually May 5, 2000, not April 5. And the May 5 alignment was invisible from Earth, lost in the Sun's glare. The April event was a visually striking grouping, but "all seven planets aligned" is an overstatement.

**5. Philpot's candor about his own bias is refreshing — and should be taken seriously.**

After presenting the 2 Esdras eagle president-by-president mapping, Philpot says: "Well, Morgan, you're seeing what you want to see. And that's true. I am. Okay? That's why you shouldn't believe anything I say" ([~16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89oEfk37E30&t=960)). This is honest. But it also invites the question: if the presenter himself acknowledges confirmation bias, should the audience extend *more* or *less* confidence to the interpretation?

### Out of Line

**1. Mapping 2 Esdras feathers to specific US presidents is speculative eisegesis.**

The core Esdras claim — that eagle feathers correspond to specific US presidents from Herbert Hoover through Donald Trump, with "contrary feathers" mapping to recent political figures — is an interpretive construct imposed on an ancient text. Even within D&C 91's permissive framework ("whoso is enlightened by the Spirit shall obtain benefit"), this requires accepting that:

- 2 Esdras 11 is genuinely prophetic (not all Apocryphal material is)
- The eagle represents the United States specifically (not Rome, which is the standard scholarly reading)
- Individual feathers correspond to individual presidents in sequence
- Modern political events can be retrofit to ancient imagery

The Bible Dictionary's "special notice" for 2 Esdras refers to *Messianic references* (7:28–29; 12:32; 13:32, 37, 52) — not to the eagle vision's political applicability. Philpot extends the BD's endorsement beyond what it actually endorses.

Philpot also cites ChatGPT's interpretation of 666 as representing "a governmental system" — citing AI as an authority on ancient textual meaning is inherently problematic, and he himself acknowledges: "I don't know if this is true… I'm not smart enough to know if ChatGPT is lying to me."

**2. April 6, 2000 was NOT the "7th day of Passover."**

Slide 215 claims April 6, 2000 is both "1 Nisan" and the "7th day of Passover." These cannot both be true. 1 Nisan is the first day of the first month. The 7th day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread (associated with Passover) is 21 Nisan — twenty days later. In 5760, that fell around April 26–27. The 1 Nisan claim is correct; the Passover claim is a factual calendar error that stacks significance onto the date beyond what the data supports.

**3. The Biden administration as "center head dies in its bed" is pure imposition.**

Interpreting 2 Esdras's eagle imagery as "the American government died under Joe Biden because Joe Biden clearly had dementia" is precisely the kind of reading D&C 91 warns about — finding what you want to find by projecting contemporary politics onto ancient text. This is not Spirit-led discernment; it is political commentary dressed in scriptural language.

**4. The 1909 = 91 BC year-by-year timeline is unfalsifiable.**

The claim that Book of Mormon events can be mapped year-by-year to American history starting from 1909 is the methodological foundation for phases 6–9. Its core problem: with enough flexibility in defining what constitutes a "parallel," any historical event can be retrofit to any Book of Mormon event. The mapping selects events that fit (McCarthy = Gadianton introduction, Watergate = Gadiantons obtain "sole management") while ignoring events that don't fit. This is not exegesis — it is pattern-matching with a predetermined conclusion.

Additionally, the starting point (1909 = 91 BC) requires accepting multiple prior claims: that Joseph F. Smith parallels Alma the Younger, that the Church's 1907 accommodation to the US government parallels the transition from kingship to judges, and that Mormon deliberately encoded four-year election cycles into his narrative. Each link in this chain multiplies the speculative probability.

### Missed the Mark

**1. The "sign of the coming of the Son of Man" deserves more canonical grounding.**

Philpot argues that the April 5–6, 2000 astronomical configuration is the "sign of the coming of the Son of Man." But [D&C 88:92–93](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p92-p93#p92) describes this sign as *immediately following* the angel's trumpet and the cry "Prepare ye, O inhabitants of the earth; for the judgment of our God is come. Behold, and lo, the Bridegroom cometh" — and says "all people shall see it together" (v. 93). The April 2000 event was not seen by "all people together," nor was it accompanied by angelic trumpets. The D&C's own description doesn't match the astronomical event Philpot identifies.

**2. Psalms 19 pivots — and the pivot matters.**

Philpot uses [Psalms 19:1–6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/19?lang=eng&id=p1-p6#p1) for its astronomical imagery: "The heavens declare the glory of God" and "a bridegroom coming out of his chamber" (vv. 1, 5). But the psalm pivots at verse 7: "The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul." The *point* of Psalms 19 is that creation testifies of God (vv. 1–6), but *the law* is what actually transforms hearts (vv. 7–11). The heavens are the preamble; the law is the substance. Using only the astronomical half of this psalm inverts its message.

**3. D&C 91 is more cautionary than Philpot acknowledges.**

The revelation says "it is not needful that the Apocrypha should be translated" — *twice* (vv. 3, 6). This isn't a ringing endorsement of building interpretive frameworks on Apocryphal texts. The Lord chose not to include 2 Esdras in the canon, chose not to have Joseph translate it, and chose to warn that "many things contained therein… are not true, which are interpolations by the hands of men" (v. 2). Philpot opens the D&C 91 door correctly but walks through it with more confidence than the revelation's tone warrants.

### Missed Opportunities

**1. Abraham 3:1–4 — the Lord's own astronomy lesson.**

Philpot discusses heavenly bodies as kingdoms governed by God's law ([D&C 88:42–49](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p42-p49#p42)) but never cites [Abraham 3:1–4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=p1-p4#p1), where the Lord shows Abraham the stars *through the Urim and Thummim* and reveals Kolob — "the great one" that "is nearest unto the throne of God" and whose reckoning of time defines celestial time. This is the Lord's own astronomical revelation to a prophet, and it would strengthen the "heavens as prophetic calendar" argument far more than Apocryphal texts.

**2. The full voice of [D&C 88:87–95](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p87-p95#p87) actually describes the signs sequence.**

Philpot references the "sign of the coming of the Son of Man" but doesn't walk through D&C 88's detailed sequence: earthquakes (v. 89), thunderings and lightnings (v. 90), "all things shall be in commotion" (v. 91), angels sounding trumpets (v. 92), *then* "immediately there shall appear a great sign in heaven, and all people shall see it together" (v. 93). This canonical sequence is more authoritative than any Apocryphal interpretation and provides clear criteria for evaluating claims about the sign.

**3. 3 Nephi 2:1–3 — the Nephites' own response to their sign.**

Philpot draws the parallel between the Nephite sign and April 2000, but the text's own sequel is sobering: within a few years, the people "began to forget those signs and wonders which they had heard, and began to be less and less astonished" ([3 Nephi 2:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p1#p1)). They began "imagining up some vain thing in their hearts, that it was wrought by men and by the power of the devil" (v. 2). If April 2000 *was* a sign, the Book of Mormon itself warns that the natural human response will be to explain it away — a warning that applies equally to those who deny signs *and* to those who manufacture them.

### Overall Assessment

Phase 6 contains Philpot's best linguistics and his most speculative politics, often on the same slide.

**The Hebrew word study is genuinely valuable.** The connection between *mō·w·'ă·ḏîm* in Genesis 1:14 and Leviticus 23 is real, important, and often missed in English-only scripture study. The theological implication — that God's heavenly bodies mark *appointed times*, not mere seasons — is worth pondering. Combined with D&C 88:42–49 and Psalms 19, this creates a scripturally grounded framework for understanding creation's testimony.

**The canonical citations are strong.** Moroni's recitation (JSH 1:36–41), Joel 2:28–32, Hinckley's October 2001 declaration, Ether 8:23–25 — these are real scriptures from real sources, correctly quoted and properly contextualized. The theological arc from Moroni ("soon to be fulfilled") through Hinckley ("has been fulfilled") is a legitimate observation.

**The Esdras material and the year-by-year timeline are speculative constructs.** Mapping Apocryphal eagle feathers to US presidents, interpreting the Biden administration as a dying eagle head, and encoding Mormon's narrative as a four-year election-cycle prophecy require too many unverifiable assumptions. Philpot's own candor — "you're seeing what you want to see" — is the appropriate self-assessment. D&C 91 opens a door to the Apocrypha, but the Lord's repeated caution that translation was "not needful" suggests He wanted readers to approach with discernment, not with detailed political timelines.

**The astronomical claims are partially verified but overstated.** A notable planetary grouping was visible from Palmyra on April 5–6, 2000 — confirmed by NASA and astronomical records. April 6, 2000 = 1 Nisan 5760. These are facts. But "all seven planets aligned" exaggerates the April event (the full alignment was May 5, 2000), and the "7th day of Passover" claim is a factual calendar error. When prophetic arguments depend on stacked date claims, getting one wrong undermines the whole structure.

**The pattern to watch:** Phase 6 sets up the 1909 = 91 BC framework that will drive Phases 7–9. The year-by-year Book of Mormon timeline is the interpretive backbone of everything that follows. Whether the remaining phases persuade will depend entirely on how tightly the parallels hold under scrutiny — or whether they require the same flexible retrofitting that characterizes the Esdras mapping.

## Step 4: Become

### Truths to Hold

1. **The heavens really do declare the glory of God** — [Psalms 19:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/19?lang=eng&id=p1#p1). The Hebrew word study is a gift. Learning that "seasons" in Genesis 1:14 means "appointed times" changes how I read the creation account. God built a prophetic calendar into the sky. What else does the Hebrew reveal that the KJV obscures?

2. **Joel's vision is unfolding** — Moroni said Joel 2:28–32 "was not yet fulfilled, but was soon to be" ([JSH 1:41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=p41#p41)). President Hinckley declared it fulfilled in 2001. I live in the era both Moroni and Joel pointed to.

3. **The Apocrypha is permitted, not required** — [D&C 91](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/91?lang=eng) gives a framework: read with the Spirit, expect both truth and interpolation, and don't treat it as canonical. The Bible Dictionary's notice of 2 Esdras's Messianic references is worth following up — but following up means reading 2 Esdras myself with the Spirit, not adopting someone else's political mapping.

### Warnings to Heed

1. **Confirmation bias is real and Philpot names it** — "You're seeing what you want to see. And that's true." When I find a pattern that excites me, do I test it against the text, or do I just build on it? The discipline of D&C 91 ("whoso receiveth not by the Spirit, cannot be benefited") cuts both ways: it's not just about *reading* with the Spirit, but about *interpreting* with the Spirit.

2. **Astronomical signs can be verified — and should be** — Philpot's claim of a seven-planet alignment on April 5, 2000 doesn't match the astronomical record (the full alignment was May 5). When prophetic claims rest on factual assertions, check the facts. Faith isn't threatened by verification; it's strengthened by it.

3. **Psalms 19 doesn't end at verse 6** — The heavens declare God's glory, but "the law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul" (v. 7). The sky points upward; the law transforms inward. Don't get so fascinated by signs in the heavens that I forget the law that actually converts.

### Commitments

- [ ] Study [2 Esdras 7:28–29; 12:32; 13:32, 37, 52](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bd/apocrypha?lang=eng&id=p28-p29#p28) — the Messianic passages the Bible Dictionary specifically highlights — and form my own impression through the Spirit, per D&C 91:5
- [ ] Read [Abraham 3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng) — the Lord's astronomy lesson to Abraham through the Urim and Thummim — as context for the "heavens as prophetic calendar" theme
- [ ] Study the seven feasts of [Leviticus 23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/23?lang=eng) and their fulfillment in Christ — the mō·w·'ă·ḏîm word study opens a whole vein of typological study (Passover → Crucifixion, Firstfruits → Resurrection, Pentecost → Spirit poured out, etc.)
