# Phase 3: The Grand Apocalyptic Vision & the Return

> Morgan Philpot — *Signs of the Times* (Chandler, AZ, 2025)
> Slides 93–120 | Part I Transcript

**Evaluation Focus:** Is the Deuteronomy 29–30 framework legitimate for latter-day application? Does the Constitution-as-patriarchal-order reading hold up? Are the Jewish calendar connections (Feast of Tabernacles 1823, Rosh Hashanah 1827) historically accurate?

## Step 1: Summary

### Main Thesis

Having established the harvest framework (Phase 1) and the urgency of the signs (Phase 2), Philpot now lays the theological *architecture* of his argument. He proposes that God has always possessed and revealed a "Grand Apocalyptic Vision" — a unified, comprehensive plan for the latter days — disclosed to his prophets across dispensations. This vision threads through Amos, Daniel, Revelation, Colossians, and into the Restoration.

The practical outworking follows a Deuteronomy 29–30 covenant pattern: God establishes a covenant → the people receive blessings → they fall into apostasy (the curse) → God orchestrates a return. Philpot maps this onto American history: the Pilgrims (1620) are established as a free people by divine design (1 Nephi 13, 3 Nephi 21:4), the Constitution becomes the instrument of that establishment, and the Restoration (beginning 1820) is "the Return" — God fulfilling the Deuteronomy 30 promise to gather his people again. The Constitution is further presented as a *patriarchal* instrument, its preamble reflecting the same preside/provide/protect functions found in the Family Proclamation.

Two calendar connections anchor the Restoration to the Israelite feast cycle: Moroni's first visit (September 21, 1823) fell on the Feast of Tabernacles, and the delivery of the gold plates (September 22, 1827) fell on Rosh Hashanah — the Feast of Trumpets. Finally, Philpot notes that Nephi's prophetic narrative reaches its limit when the angel tells him that the apostle John will complete the latter-day vision (1 Nephi 14:25–27).

### Key Claims

1. **"Grand Apocalyptic Vision"** — God has always revealed his complete latter-day plan to prophets across dispensations (Amos 3:7 → Daniel 2:28 → Revelation 10:7 → Colossians 1:26) (slides 93–96)
2. **"Start with Moses"** — Deuteronomy 29–30 provides the master covenant pattern: covenant → blessing → curse → return → gathering (slides 97, 112–113)
3. **1620 as the "set time"** — The Pilgrims' arrival fulfills 3 Nephi 21:4 and 1 Nephi 13:12–16: Gentiles established as a free people by the Father's power (slides 98, 100–101)
4. **Constitution as patriarchal instrument** — The preamble's functions (establish justice, insure tranquility, provide for defense, promote welfare, secure liberty) map onto the Family Proclamation's preside/provide/protect framework (slides 103–106)
5. **Oaks quote on priesthood in the family** — "A father presides and exercises the priesthood in his family by the authority of the priesthood he holds. He has no need to have the direction or approval of one holding priesthood keys" (slide 104)
6. **Deuteronomy 28:1 = 1 Nephi 13:30** — "Set thee on high above all nations" parallels "lifted up by the power of God above all other nations" (slides 108–109)
7. **"The Return" = the Restoration** — The Restoration fulfills Deuteronomy 30:1–3: after the scattering and the curse, God gathers his people again (slides 110–114)
8. **September 21, 1823 = Feast of Tabernacles** — Moroni's first visit to Joseph Smith coincides with the Jewish holiday (slide 115)
9. **September 22, 1827 = Rosh Hashanah / Feast of Trumpets** — The gold plates are delivered on the day associated with God remembering his covenants (slide 117)
10. **Nephi hands off to John** — 1 Nephi 14:25–27: Nephi is told not to write the remainder because the apostle John is ordained to write it (slide 120)

### Word Study

**Mystery** (Webster 1828): "A profound secret; something wholly unknown, or something kept cautiously concealed, and therefore exciting curiosity or wonder; something which has not been or can not be explained." In scripture, the word consistently refers to something God *has known* but *has not yet revealed* to mortals — not a puzzle to decode, but a truth to be disclosed by revelation. Colossians 1:26 uses precisely this sense: "the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints."

### Jewish Calendar Verification

**September 21, 1823 = Feast of Tabernacles:** Confirmed by Scripture Central, FAIR, LDS Living, and a Latter-day Saint Magazine article. The Hebrew calendar is lunar-based and shifts annually; independent verification of the 1823 alignment has been published by multiple Latter-day Saint scholarly outlets.

**September 22, 1827 = Rosh Hashanah / Feast of Trumpets:** Confirmed by an official Church *Ensign* article (January 2000), Scripture Central, FAIR, and the *Deseret News*. The article notes: "The Feast of Trumpets, with prayers pleading for God's remembrance of his still-exiled people, had begun at sundown the previous evening. The services continued that morning, with a worldwide sounding of the ram's horn."

## Step 4: Evaluation

### In Line

**1. The "Grand Apocalyptic Vision" Scripture Chain — Strong**

Philpot threads four scriptures together to argue that God has always revealed a unified latter-day plan to his prophets. Each verse, independently, supports this conclusion:

- [Amos 3:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/amos/3?lang=eng&id=p7#p7): "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets." The word "surely" and the scope "will do nothing" are absolute — *nothing* is excluded from prophetic forewarning.

- [Daniel 2:28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/2?lang=eng&id=p28#p28): "There is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days." The dream itself — the stone cut without hands destroying the image — explicitly concerns the *latter days* (v. 28) and the God of heaven setting up "a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed" (v. 44).

- [Revelation 10:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/10?lang=eng&id=p7#p7): "In the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets." The phrase "as he hath declared to his servants the prophets" links back directly to Amos 3:7 — John is confirming the same principle.

- [Colossians 1:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/col/1?lang=eng&id=p26#p26): "Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints." Paul uses mystery (*mystērion*) not as something permanently unknowable but as something God held in reserve and now *reveals*. Webster 1828 confirms this usage: "A profound secret; something wholly unknown, or something kept cautiously concealed."

The synthesis — that these four witnesses form a chain testifying of a single, coherent divine plan for the last days — is Philpot's interpretive contribution, but it rests on solid textual ground. Each passage independently affirms that God reveals his purposes; together they form a credible cross-testamental witness.

**2. 3 Nephi 21:4 — Gentiles Established for the Covenant's Sake — Explicit**

This is not inference; it's the risen Christ speaking:

> "It is wisdom in the Father that they should be established in this land, and be set up as a free people by the power of the Father, that these things might come forth from them unto a remnant of your seed, that the covenant of the Father may be fulfilled" — [3 Nephi 21:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/21?lang=eng&id=p4#p4)

The verse explicitly states: (1) the Gentiles were established in this land, (2) by the Father's power, (3) as a free people, (4) *so that* the gospel record could come through them to the remnant of Lehi's seed, (5) *so that* the Father's covenant could be fulfilled. Philpot doesn't need to build a case here — Christ built it for him. President Benson quoted this same verse in ["Our Divine Constitution"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1987/10/our-divine-constitution?lang=eng) to make the same point: "The Lord's latter-day base of operations for His restored church."

**3. 1 Nephi 13:12–19 — Nephi's Vision of the Gentile Nation — Textually Clear**

Nephi saw it all in vision:

- "A man among the Gentiles" wrought upon by the Spirit to cross the waters (v. 12 — traditionally identified as Columbus)
- Gentiles who "went forth out of captivity, upon the many waters" (v. 13)
- They "humbled themselves before the Lord; and the power of the Lord was with them" (v. 16)
- "The wrath of God was upon all those that were gathered together against them to battle" (v. 18)
- Delivered "by the power of God out of the hands of all other nations" (v. 19)

This is Nephi's *own vision*, not Philpot's interpretation. The connection to the American founding is long-established in Latter-day Saint teaching. Philpot accurately presents the text.

**4. D&C 101:80 — Constitution Established by Wise Men — Explicit Doctrine**

> "For this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed the land by the shedding of blood." — [D&C 101:80](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101?lang=eng&id=p80#p80)

This is the Lord speaking in first person to the restored Church. The Constitution is divinely established — not merely tolerated or accommodated, but *established*. The "wise men" were "raised up unto this very purpose." This is settled Church doctrine, taught by a sustained line of prophets from Joseph Smith through President Benson to the present.

**5. Jewish Calendar Alignments — Historically Confirmed**

Philpot's two calendar claims check out:

- **September 21, 1823 = Feast of Tabernacles:** Confirmed by Scripture Central, FAIR, LDS Living, and a Latter-day Saint Magazine article. The Hebrew calendar is lunar-based and shifts yearly; independent verification confirms the alignment.

- **September 22, 1827 = Rosh Hashanah (Feast of Trumpets):** Confirmed by an official Church *Ensign* article (January 2000): "The golden plates were delivered to the young Prophet Joseph Smith early in the morning of 22 September 1827. The Feast of Trumpets, with prayers pleading for God's remembrance of his still-exiled people, had begun at sundown the previous evening."

Furthermore, Scripture Central documents that each of Moroni's annual visits fell on or near a different Jewish feast: 1823 = Tabernacles, 1824 = eve of Rosh Hashanah, 1825 = Yom Kippur, 1827 = Rosh Hashanah. This is not Philpot's discovery — it's published scholarship from Latter-day Saint academic outlets. The facts are solid; the question is what interpretive weight they bear (see Nuanced below).

**6. 1 Nephi 14:25–27 — Nephi Hands Off to John — Textually Explicit**

> "The things which thou shalt see hereafter thou shalt not write; for the Lord God hath ordained the apostle of the Lamb of God that he should write them." — [1 Nephi 14:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14?lang=eng&id=p25#p25)

> "The name of the apostle of the Lamb was John" — [1 Nephi 14:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14?lang=eng&id=p27#p27)

The text is unambiguous: Nephi saw the remainder of the vision but was forbidden from writing it. John received the assignment. Philpot's observation that Nephi's prophetic narrative reaches its "limit" here — and that the Revelation of John picks up where Nephi stops — is a textually grounded and insightful reading that many casual readers miss.

**7. Deuteronomy 30:1–3 as a Gathering Pattern — Textually Sound**

> "When all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither the Lord thy God hath driven thee, And shalt return unto the Lord thy God... the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations" — [Deuteronomy 30:1–3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/30?lang=eng&id=p1-p3#p1)

The covenant pattern — blessing → curse → scattering → return → gathering — is embedded in the text and is the central dynamic of Israelite covenant theology. That the Restoration constitutes a "return" and "gathering" after centuries of apostasy (the curse) is standard Latter-day Saint doctrine. The question is whether Deuteronomy was speaking *specifically* about the American experience or describing a *general pattern* that applies here (see Nuanced below).

### Nuanced — Handle with Care

**1. Constitution as Patriarchal Instrument — Creative but Unsupported by Authority**

This is Philpot's most original — and most fragile — interpretive contribution (slides 103–106). His argument:

1. The Family Proclamation says fathers "preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection"
2. The Constitution preamble's functions can be categorized as: "establish Justice" = *presiding* authority; "insure domestic Tranquility" and "provide for the common defence" = *protect*; "promote the general Welfare" = *provide*; "secure the Blessings of Liberty" = *presiding* again
3. President Oaks taught that fathers exercise priesthood in the family without needing direction from priesthood keys
4. Therefore: the Constitution operates as a patriarchal instrument establishing the same order

The problems are not with the individual pieces but with the assembly:

**The Oaks quote is about priesthood in the family, not civil government.** The full context from ["The Melchizedek Priesthood and the Keys"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2020/04/36oaks?lang=eng) makes this clear. Oaks specifies the "various family functions" as: "counseling the members of his family, holding family meetings, giving priesthood blessings to his wife and children, or giving healing blessings to family members or others." He is distinguishing *family* priesthood from *Church* priesthood governance. Extending this principle to *civil government* is a categorical leap — one Oaks himself does not make.

**The Lord's stated purpose for the Constitution is different.** [D&C 101:77–78](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101?lang=eng&id=p77-p78#p77) tells us *why* God established the Constitution: "for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles; That every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity, according to the moral agency which I have given unto him." The purpose is *moral agency* — every person's freedom to choose, to worship, to act. [D&C 98:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) adds: "supporting that principle of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges, belongs to all mankind." The Lord frames the Constitution in terms of *freedom* and *agency*, not in terms of *patriarchal order*.

**No prophet or apostle has taught this reading.** President Benson's ["Our Divine Constitution"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1987/10/our-divine-constitution?lang=eng) is the most comprehensive prophetic treatment of the Constitution in modern Church history. He calls it "divinely inspired," cites D&C 101, 1 Nephi 13, 3 Nephi 21:4, recounts the Founding Fathers' temple work, and emphasizes the need for moral people to sustain it. At no point does he frame it as a priesthood or patriarchal document. Neither does any other prophet or apostle in the conference record.

The Constitution can be divinely inspired (it is — D&C 101:80 says so) without being a priesthood instrument. The Family Proclamation describes the *family order*; the Constitution describes the *civil order*. They may share *values* (protection, provision, ordered liberty), but shared values don't make them the same kind of document. The preside/provide/protect mapping onto the preamble is clever wordplay, but it proves resemblance, not identity.

**2. Deuteronomy 28 "Above All Nations" = 1 Nephi 13:30 "Above All Other Nations" — Similar but Different**

Philpot's parallel (slides 108–109):

- [Deuteronomy 28:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/28?lang=eng&id=p1#p1): "The Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth"
- [1 Nephi 13:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13?lang=eng&id=p30#p30): "Lifted up by the power of God above all other nations"

The language is remarkably similar. But the *mechanism* differs:

- Deuteronomy 28 is a *conditional covenant blessing*: **if** Israel hearkens diligently → **then** God will set them on high. The blessing is contingent on obedience. The same chapter prescribes devastating curses if they disobey (v. 15–68).
- 1 Nephi 13:30 describes *divine providence* for a specific purpose: the Gentiles are lifted up *so that* the gospel can come forth through them. The logic is purposive, not conditional in the same way.

Philpot treats these as essentially the same promise applied to the same people. But Deuteronomy is addressing *Israel* at the Jordan River; 1 Nephi is describing *Gentiles* in a new land. The parallel enriches the reading of both texts, but the listener should understand that Nephi is describing a *new application* of a *similar pattern*, not a direct fulfillment of Deuteronomy 28 for the same covenant people.

**3. Deuteronomy 29–30 Applied to America — Typologically Valid, Not Direct Prophecy**

The blessing/curse/return pattern of Deuteronomy 29–30 genuinely resonates with the narrative arc Philpot traces: God establishes a covenant people → apostasy and scattering follow → God initiates a return and gathering. This is the *master pattern* of all covenant history — it applies to Israel in Babylon, to the Nephites and Lamanites, and to the Restoration.

But Moses was speaking to literal Israel at the plains of Moab. Deuteronomy 29:14–15 ("with him that is not here with us this day") is typically understood as extending the covenant to future *Israelite* generations, not to a Gentile nation 3,400 years later. The application to America and the Restoration is a *typological inference* — the same pattern operating in a new context. This is legitimate scriptural reasoning (and consistent with the "likening" principle from 1 Nephi 19:23), but it should be acknowledged as *application*, not as Moses prophesying about Jamestown and Plymouth Rock.

The stronger approach would be to anchor the American covenant theology in the scriptures that *actually describe it*: [Ether 2:8–12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p8-p12#p8) ("whatsoever nation shall possess it shall serve God, or they shall be swept off"), [2 Nephi 1:5–9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p5-p9#p5) (Lehi's explicit covenant for the promised land), and [3 Nephi 21:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/21?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) (Christ's own statement about the Gentile establishment). These are *direct* revelations about this land; Deuteronomy is a *parallel pattern*.

**4. The Calendar Alignments — Factual but Interpretively Delicate**

The Jewish feast-day alignments for Moroni's visits are *historically confirmed* — this is not disputed. The question is what weight the coincidences bear.

Possibilities range from (a) God deliberately orchestrated Restoration events to fall on Israelite feast days, signaling continuity between old and new covenants, to (b) September is simply the time of year when autumnal equinox feasts cluster, and the alignment is statistically unremarkable given a multi-day feast window.

The Church's own Ensign (January 2000) presented the Rosh Hashanah connection in careful, appreciative language — noting the beauty of God remembering his exiled people on the very day Jews prayed for that remembrance. This is devotionally rich. Philpot uses it more aggressively — as structural evidence for his feast-calendar framework from Phase 1. The data supports wonder and appreciation; whether it supports systematic prophetic-calendar theory is a separate and larger claim.

Compare this with [D&C 20:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20?lang=eng&id=p1#p1), which dates the Church's organization to "the sixth day of the month which is called April" — no reference to Jewish feasts. The Lord himself, when recording the founding date, used the Gentile calendar. This doesn't disprove the feast-day connections, but it suggests the Lord doesn't treat them as primary markers of meaning.

### Out of Line

Nothing in Phase 3 is clearly out of line with scripture or prophetic teaching. Unlike Phase 2's date-setting from John 4:40 and the Walk to Emmaus typology, Phase 3 works from scriptures that genuinely address America, the Constitution, and the Restoration. The Constitution-as-patriarchal-order reading *stretches*, but it doesn't contradict any doctrine — it adds an interpretive layer that no prophet has added. The difference between "creative and unsupported" (Nuanced) and "contradicts the text or prophets" (Out of Line) matters: Phase 3 stays on the creative side of that boundary.

### Missed the Mark

**Philpot's Detour Around D&C 101:77–80**

This is a striking omission. Philpot builds an entire section on the divine purpose of the Constitution using 3 Nephi 21:4, the preamble, the Family Proclamation, and an Oaks quote — but largely bypasses [D&C 101:77–80](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101?lang=eng&id=p77-p80#p77), where the Lord *himself* explains why he established the Constitution.

The Lord's stated purposes:
1. "The rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles" (v. 77)
2. "That every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity, according to the moral agency which I have given unto him" (v. 78)
3. "That every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment" (v. 78)
4. "It is not right that any man should be in bondage one to another" (v. 79)

These verses tell us the Constitution exists to protect *agency*. Every person must be free to choose, to worship, to act according to conscience — and to be *accountable* for those choices. That's the divine logic: freedom enables accountability, and accountability requires freedom.

By framing the Constitution primarily through the patriarchal lens (preside/provide/protect), Philpot substitutes an *interpretive* framework for the Lord's *stated* framework. The result is a less accurate picture of *why* God established the Constitution — and a missed opportunity to teach the profound connection between agency, accountability, and divine government that D&C 101 articulates.

### Missed Opportunities

**1. Ether 2:8–12 — The Governing Covenant for the Promised Land**

This is the foundational scripture for covenant theology about the American land, and it's absent from Philpot's slides:

> "This is a land which is choice above all other lands; wherefore he that doth possess it shall serve God or shall be swept off; for it is the everlasting decree of God. And it is not until the fulness of iniquity among the children of the land, that they are swept off." — [Ether 2:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p10#p10)

> "Whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ." — [Ether 2:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p12#p12)

This verse provides the *conditional covenant* that undergirds everything Philpot is arguing about America's divine destiny. It's written to the Gentile reader ("this cometh unto you, O ye Gentiles," v. 11) and spoken with binding authority ("the everlasting decree of God," v. 10). Deuteronomy 28–30 is a *parallel pattern*; Ether 2 is a *direct address* to this land's inhabitants.

If Philpot had opened with Ether 2:12 instead of Deuteronomy 28, his entire theological arc would be stronger — because Ether 2 is explicitly about *this* land, *this* people, *this* covenant. The connection to Deuteronomy would then be an enriching parallel rather than the primary foundation.

**2. Mosiah 29 — The Book of Mormon's Model of Self-Governance**

When Mosiah transitions from kings to judges, he articulates principles that read like a scriptural prototype for republican government:

> "Choose you by the voice of this people, judges, that ye may be judged according to the laws which have been given you by our fathers" — [Mosiah 29:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/29?lang=eng&id=p25#p25)

> "It is not common that the voice of the people desireth anything contrary to that which is right; but it is common for the lesser part of the people to desire that which is not right; therefore this shall ye observe and make it your law — to do your business by the voice of the people" — [Mosiah 29:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/29?lang=eng&id=p26#p26)

> "If the time comes that the voice of the people doth choose iniquity, then is the time that the judgments of God will come upon you" — [Mosiah 29:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/29?lang=eng&id=p27#p27)

> "I desire that this land be a land of liberty, and every man may enjoy his rights and privileges alike" — [Mosiah 29:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/29?lang=eng&id=p32#p32)

This is the scriptural precedent for self-governance in the promised land — wise judges chosen by the voice of the people, accountable to divine law, with collective blessings or curses tied to collective righteousness. It contains the same *conditional pattern* as Deuteronomy 28–30 (obedience → blessing; iniquity → judgment) but applied to a people *on this continent*. Mosiah even uses the phrase "wise men" (v. 11) — echoing the "wise men" of D&C 101:80.

**3. D&C 98:4–10 — The Lord's Instructions for Relating to Constitutional Law**

Philpot discusses the Constitution's *origin* (divine) but not the Saints' *obligation* toward it. D&C 98 provides this:

> "That law of the land which is constitutional, supporting that principle of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges, belongs to all mankind, and is justifiable before me." — [D&C 98:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98?lang=eng&id=p5#p5)

> "Whatsoever is more or less than this, cometh of evil." — [D&C 98:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98?lang=eng&id=p7#p7)

> "When the wicked rule the people mourn." — [D&C 98:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98?lang=eng&id=p9#p9)

> "Honest men and wise men should be sought for diligently, and good men and wise men ye should observe to uphold." — [D&C 98:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98?lang=eng&id=p10#p10)

These verses move from theology (the Constitution is divine) to *application* (choose wise leaders, befriend constitutional law, resist excess). Combined with the Mosiah 29 "voice of the people" principle, this forms a complete scriptural framework for civic engagement — one that demands *active participation* rather than merely admiring providential design.

**4. President Benson's "Our Divine Constitution" (October 1987) — Comprehensive Prophetic Treatment**

[This talk](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1987/10/our-divine-constitution?lang=eng) covers nearly every theme Philpot addresses: D&C 101:80, 1 Nephi 13:12–19, 3 Nephi 21:4, 2 Nephi 1:8, 2 Nephi 10:11, the Founding Fathers' temple work, the Kirtland Temple dedicatory prayer, George Washington's inaugural address, and even Joseph Smith's prophecy about the Constitution being "upon the brink of ruin." President Benson does what Philpot attempts — but with prophetic authority and without the creative stretches. This talk would be a powerful companion piece for any listener studying Philpot's Phase 3 claims.

### Overall Assessment

Phase 3 is the *architectural* section of Philpot's presentation — where he builds the theological scaffolding that holds Phases 4–9 together. It is significantly stronger than Phase 2 and comparable to Phase 1 in its fidelity to the scriptural text.

**Strengths:**
- The "Grand Apocalyptic Vision" scripture chain (Amos → Daniel → Revelation → Colossians) is well-constructed, and each individual verse genuinely teaches that God reveals his plan to prophets
- 3 Nephi 21:4 and 1 Nephi 13 are used faithfully and directly — Christ and Nephi explicitly describe the Gentile nation's divine establishment
- The Deuteronomy 29–30 covenant pattern (blessing → curse → return → gathering) is textually embedded and its application to the Restoration is reasonable
- The Jewish calendar alignments are *historically confirmed* — not speculation but published Latter-day Saint scholarship
- The Nephi-to-John handoff (1 Nephi 14:25–27) is an insightful observation about prophetic scope that many readers miss

**Cautions:**
- The Constitution-as-patriarchal-instrument reading (preside/provide/protect from the preamble) is Philpot's most creative contribution and his most unsupported. The Oaks quote is about families, not government. The Lord's own stated purpose for the Constitution (D&C 101:77–80) is about agency and freedom, not patriarchal order. No prophet has taught this reading.
- Deuteronomy is a *parallel pattern* to the American covenant, not its source. Ether 2:8–12 and 2 Nephi 1:5–9 are the *direct* revelations about this land.
- The calendar alignments are beautiful but should not be pressed into proof of a comprehensive feast-day framework without more care. The Church itself has presented them with wonder, not as systematic evidence.

**Phase 3's Contribution to the Whole:** This phase does its job well — it establishes that God had a plan, that America is part of it, that the Restoration fulfills a covenant return, and that the scriptures provide the map. The listener who takes even the nuanced material seriously will come away with a richer understanding of 1 Nephi 13, 3 Nephi 21, and the Deuteronomic covenant pattern. The primary risk is the patriarchal-Constitution reading, which could lead listeners to confuse *divine inspiration* of the Constitution (settled doctrine per D&C 101:80) with the Constitution being a *priesthood document* (which no prophet has taught and the text does not support).

**Recommendation:** Study 3 Nephi 21:1–7 and 1 Nephi 13 together — these are the Savior's and Nephi's own descriptions of why America exists. Read Ether 2:8–12 as the governing covenant for the promised land. Read Benson's "Our Divine Constitution" as the authoritative prophetic treatment of the themes Philpot raises. Hold the patriarchal-Constitution reading loosely — it's creative but has no prophetic support. And marvel at the Jewish calendar alignments, because they *are* remarkable — while remembering that not every remarkable coincidence is a systematic key.

## Step 5: Become

> *"Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection."* — [D&C 130:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130?lang=eng&id=p18#p18)

### Truths to Apply

- **God reveals the plan.** Amos 3:7 isn't aspirational — it's a standing policy. Before great events, God warns through prophets. This means the prophetic voices speaking *now* (President Nelson, the Twelve) carry information about what's coming. The duty is to listen, not just reverently but *strategically* — asking, "What is the Lord preparing me for?"

- **America exists for a covenant purpose.** 3 Nephi 21:4 is the Savior's own declaration: the Gentiles were established as a free people *so that* the covenant could be fulfilled. This means American liberty is not an end in itself — it is an instrument for God's work. The Constitution's value is measured by how effectively it enables the gospel to go forth.

- **The gathering IS the return.** The Deuteronomy 30 pattern (curse → return → gathering) is the Restoration's own narrative. We are living in the "return" phase. Every missionary called, every temple built, every ordinance performed is an act of gathering — fulfilling the covenant that Moses described and Christ commissioned.

- **Moroni came on covenant days.** Whether by providence or coincidence, the Feast of Tabernacles (God dwelling with his people) and Rosh Hashanah (God remembering his exiled people) frame the beginning of the Restoration. These connections are published, verified, and devotionally rich. They deepen the sense that the Restoration did not happen in a vacuum but in a context saturated with prophetic meaning.

### Warnings to Heed

- **Don't confuse divine inspiration with priesthood identity.** The Constitution is divinely inspired (D&C 101:80). The family is organized by priesthood (Family Proclamation). These are both true. They are not the same thing. Conflating civil government with priesthood order risks either sacralizing the state or secularizing the priesthood. The Lord kept these domains distinct for a reason.

- **Typology illuminates; it doesn't legislate.** Deuteronomy 29–30 enriches our understanding of the Restoration by providing a pattern. But it doesn't *govern* the Restoration — the Lord's own revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants do. Always anchor in the direct revelation before reaching for the typological parallel.

- **Ether's covenant is conditional.** "Whatsoever nation shall possess [this land] shall serve God, or they shall be swept off" ([Ether 2:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p9#p9)). The divine destiny of the American land is not guaranteed by geography or founding documents — it requires the ongoing faithfulness of those who dwell here. The covenant is an invitation and a warning, not a promise of permanent protection.
