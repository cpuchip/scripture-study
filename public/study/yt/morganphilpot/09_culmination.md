# Phase 9: The Two Great Lights & Culmination

> Morgan Philpot — *Signs of the Times* (Chandler, AZ, 2025)
> Slides 356–369 | Part III Transcript (~0:00–1:00:00)

**Evaluation Focus:** The future projections are the most speculative portion. Distinguish between what the scriptures actually say about the events preceding Christ's coming vs. what requires Philpot's specific timeline framework. The Hebrew word studies (Kokaubeam, kōwḵāḇ) should be verified. What do the scriptures *actually* promise about timing vs. what Philpot reads into them?

**Bias Alert:** End-times date-setting is where training biases will be strongest. D&C 49:7 says "the hour and the day no man knoweth," but that doesn't mean God hasn't given patterns and signs. Both principles are true simultaneously. Additionally, the user observes that God uses disruptive events to draw His children closer — like the poor Zoramites being cast out of their synagogues ([Alma 32:2–6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p2-p6#p2)), which humbled them and prepared them to hear the word. COVID temple closures may serve a similar divine purpose: Saints were compelled to worship at home, study as families, and administer the sacrament through their own priesthood authority.

## Step 1: Summary

### Main Thesis

Phase 9 is the culmination of the entire presentation, weaving together three final threads:

1. **The Two Great Lights and the Star (Slides 356–369)** — A word study connecting Genesis 1:16 ("two great lights"), Helaman 14:3–5 (Samuel's signs), Numbers 24:17 ("a Star out of Jacob"), and Abraham 3:13/16 (Kokaubeam = "stars, or all the great lights") to argue that the "new star" of Helaman 14:5 is not merely a celestial object but a *Kokaubeam* — one of the "great lights" — potentially a new sun or moon, connecting the signs of Christ's first coming to signs of the Second Coming through "chiasmus foreshadowing."

2. **The Speculative Timeline: 2025–2033** — Extending the Book of Mormon / modern parallel framework from prior phases into a detailed future projection: contentious election (2028), assassination of "Laconius" (2029), secession crisis (2030–2031), no-trespass laws and economic collapse, and great destruction parallel to 3 Nephi 8 (2033), followed by Christ's visit.

3. **The Three Harvests and the Wedding at Cana** — Revelation 14's grape harvest as the transition from the wheat harvest (gathering) to divine wrath; the olive harvest as Adam-ondi-Ahman; the Wedding at Cana as the moment when bread (barley + wheat) and wine (grape harvest) are ready for the Bridegroom. The New Jerusalem (Ether 13) as Zion built by the "seed of Joseph Smith."

## Step 3: Evaluation

### In Line

**The Kokaubeam / kōwḵāḇ Word Connection Is Linguistically Sound**

The word study across slides 365–368 traces a real linguistic thread. The Hebrew *kōwḵāḇ* (כּוֹכָב) in Numbers 24:17 ("there shall come a Star out of Jacob") is indeed the same root that Abraham 3:13 renders as "Kokob, which is star" and extends to "Kokaubeam, which signifies stars, or all the great lights, which were in the firmament of heaven." The connection between the plural *Kokaubeam* and Genesis 1:16's "two great lights" plus "he made the stars also" is textually grounded — Abraham 3:13 explicitly equates Kokaubeam with "all the great lights." This is not Philpot's invention; it's what the text says.

The question Philpot raises — whether the "new star" of [Helaman 14:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) might be more than a typical star, given the Kokaubeam framework — is a legitimate hermeneutical question. Samuel says "there shall a new star arise, such an one as ye never have beheld." The qualification "such an one as ye never have beheld" does suggest something unprecedented. Within the Abrahamic astronomical vocabulary where *Kokaubeam* encompasses sun, moon, and stars as "great lights," asking what category this new light belongs to is a fair reading, not a forced one.

**Isaiah 13 and 3 Nephi 8 Share Genuine Prophetic DNA**

Isaiah 13:13 — "I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the Lord of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger" — and 3 Nephi 8's description of the destruction at Christ's death resonate with each other not because Philpot forces them together but because the chapter heading of Isaiah 13 says so: "The destruction of Babylon is a type of the destruction at the Second Coming." The shared language — darkened sun (Isa. 13:10 / 3 Ne. 8:22), earth shaking (Isa. 13:13 / 3 Ne. 8:6), hearts melting (Isa. 13:7 / 3 Ne. 8:23) — reveals that Isaiah's vision, the Nephite destruction, and the future Second Coming are all reflections of the same divine pattern. This is how scripture works: the destruction at Christ's first coming *is* a type and shadow of the destruction at His second.

The chapter heading even adds: "Compare [2 Nephi 23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/23?lang=eng)." Nephi included Isaiah 13 in his own record — the Book of Mormon authors themselves saw this connection.

**Mormon's Storm/Tempest Distinction Is Real and Significant**

Philpot observes that [3 Nephi 8:5–6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/8?lang=eng&id=p5-p6#p5) uses both "storm" and "tempest" separately: "there arose a great storm" (v.5) and "there was also a great and terrible tempest" (v.6). He then cites the Webster 1828 definitions, which confirm a distinction: *storm* can mean "a violent assault on a fortified place" (definition 4 — a political/military meaning), while *tempest* is specifically a natural weather phenomenon ("a sudden and violent storm... usually attended by a heavy rain, with lightning and thunder").

The observation is linguistically valid. Mormon, through Joseph Smith's translation, uses two English words that the 1828 dictionary distinguishes. Whether Mormon intended us to read a political *and* natural catastrophe in tandem is interpretive, but the vocabulary choice is real, and the Webster 1828 definitions do support distinct meanings. The approach of examining scripture vocabulary through the dictionary of Joseph Smith's era is methodologically sound — it's the same approach we use throughout these studies.

**Nelson's Final Talk Carries Genuinely Unprecedented Urgency**

President Nelson's [October 2024 talk](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2024/10/57nelson?lang=eng), "The Lord Jesus Christ Will Come Again," is remarkable not for any single quote (though "now is the time for you and for me to prepare for the Second Coming" is about as direct as a prophet can be) but for its cumulative effect as a *final* message. This was Nelson's farewell address to the Church. He chose to spend it entirely on the Second Coming — not temples (though he announced 17 more), not policy, not organizational matters.

He declared: "In a coming day, Jesus Christ will return to the earth as the millennial Messiah. So today I call upon you to rededicate your lives to Jesus Christ. I call upon you to help gather scattered Israel and to prepare the world for the Second Coming of the Lord."

And he spoke of the New Jerusalem: "Jesus Christ will govern from both old Jerusalem and the New Jerusalem 'built upon the American continent.'" He cited [Ether 13:3–10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p3-p10#p3) in his footnotes — the same passage Philpot builds his New Jerusalem argument on.

Philpot is right that this prophetic urgency is striking. The prophet is saying "prepare now." That is worth taking seriously regardless of any specific timeline one might construct around it.

**God Uses Disruptive Events to Humble and Prepare His People**

The pattern of God using hardship to draw His children closer — even the hardship of being "cast out" of places of worship — is scripturally deep. The parallel to COVID is genuinely powerful:

The poor Zoramites of [Alma 32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng) were "cast out of the synagogues because of the coarseness of their apparel" (v.2). They were "esteemed by their brethren as dross" (v.3). They had "no place to worship" their God (v.5). And Alma says: "I behold that ye are lowly in heart; and if so, blessed are ye" (v.8). He then declares: "It is well that ye are cast out of your synagogues, that ye may be humble, and that ye may learn wisdom" (v.12).

When COVID closed the temples and chapels in March 2020, Latter-day Saints faced a strikingly similar situation: cast out of their places of worship, unable to perform ordinances through institutional channels. But many discovered what Alma taught:

> "Do ye suppose that ye cannot worship God save it be in your synagogues only? And moreover, I would ask, do ye suppose that ye must not worship God only once in a week?" ([Alma 32:10–11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p10-p11#p10))

Fathers administered the sacrament in their homes. Families studied Come Follow Me together. Ward members connected outside the institutional building. The very disruption that seemed catastrophic became — for many — a season of humbling that prepared hearts to hear the word.

This doesn't mean COVID was divine punishment (Phase 8 addressed that distinction carefully). It means the Lord uses events — including painful ones — to create conditions where humility can take root. The Zoramite pattern reveals this: being cast out was not the goal; being humbled enough to hear was. As Alma says, those who are "compelled to be humble" and then seek repentance "shall find mercy" (v.13). But even more blessed are "they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble" (v.16).

The lesson is not "COVID was judgment" but "disruption can become preparation" — and the scriptural precedent for this principle runs deep.

### Nuanced

**"Second Coming Chiasmus Foreshadowing" — Interesting but Undemonstrated**

Slide 359 includes a parenthetical claiming that Helaman 14:2's reference to Christ's coming "to redeem all those who shall believe on his name" is "second coming chiasmus foreshadowing; the Second Coming is a different type of coming than the redemptive First Coming." This is an interpretive assertion, not something the text states.

The text of Helaman 14 *does* describe signs for both events — the birth (v.2–7) and the death (v.14–28). Both sets of signs involve cosmic phenomena (light, darkness, earthquakes). So there is a structural parallel. But calling it "chiasmus foreshadowing" of the Second Coming goes beyond what the text claims. Samuel explicitly says his signs are for "the time of his coming" (v.3) — meaning the first coming — and for "his death" (v.14). He does not claim to be prophesying the Second Coming.

That said, the *pattern* of birth signs/death signs serving as types for return signs is a legitimate hermeneutical framework. 3 Nephi 8's destruction *is* a type of Second Coming destruction (Isaiah 13's heading tells us so). Whether Samuel *intended* this chiastic second-meaning is uncertain; whether God embedded it is a different question.

**Eclipse Interpretation Is Culturally Suggestive but Scripturally Unsupported**

Slide 356 ("Making Sense of The Eclipses") introduces the 2017 and 2024 total solar eclipses over the United States. These eclipses are real astronomical events. The fact that their paths formed an "X" across the United States is visually striking.

However, no scripture assigns prophetic significance to solar eclipses. Genesis 1:14 says the lights are "for signs, and for seasons" — but this is a general statement about astronomical markers for calendar reckoning. The scriptural signs given for the Second Coming are more dramatic: the sun shall be "darkened" ([Isaiah 13:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/13?lang=eng&id=p10#p10)), the moon shall not give light, the stars shall fall — not eclipse-level temporary events but permanent cosmic alterations.

Eclipses are natural, predictable phenomena. Reading prophetic significance into them risks the same association-as-proof pattern we've flagged throughout this series.

**Revelation 14 Harvest Framework Is Scripturally Grounded but Timing Application Is Speculative**

Revelation 14 genuinely does describe a two-phase harvest: first the grain harvest (v.14–16: "Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe"), then the grape harvest (v.17–20: "Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe"). The grain harvest is gathering; the grape harvest is judgment ("the great winepress of the wrath of God," v.19).

Philpot's connection between this two-phase harvest and the broader last-days timeline is conceptually compelling. The wheat/grape distinction maps naturally to the gathering/judgment phases of the Lord's work. His artistic connection to the Wedding at Cana (bread + wine = Bridegroom ready) is homiletically beautiful.

But the claim that "the wheat harvest is over" — a specific temporal assertion — is not something Revelation 14 permits us to determine from the text alone. When Philpot says "if the fig shoots have already appeared and we've started the summer harvest," he is mapping his timeline onto the scriptural framework rather than deriving it from the framework. The harvest imagery tells us *what will happen sequentially*; it does not tell us *when we are in the sequence*.

**New Jerusalem / "Seed of Joseph Smith" Reading Is Partially Supported**

Ether 13:6 says the New Jerusalem will be "built up upon this land, unto the remnant of the seed of Joseph." Verse 7 connects this to Joseph who saved his family by bringing them to Egypt. Philpot reads "Joseph" here as a type of Joseph Smith, making the "seed of Joseph" the believers in the Restoration.

There is genuine typological basis for this: Joseph Smith's patriarchal blessing identified him as of the lineage of Joseph. Joseph of Egypt explicitly prophesied of a future Joseph (Joseph Smith) in [2 Nephi 3:6–15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p6-p15#p6). And President Nelson himself spoke of "the New Jerusalem 'built upon the American continent'" and cited [Ether 13:3–10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p3-p10#p3) in his footnotes.

However, "the seed of Joseph" in Ether 13 is specifically geographical/cultural — the covenant people on the American continent who come from the Lehite/Josephite lineage. While Restoration believers are grafted into this covenant through the Abrahamic covenant (and thus into Joseph's lineage spiritually), equating "seed of Joseph" solely with "believers in Joseph Smith's doctrine" is a narrower reading than the text requires. The passage is primarily about covenant Israel on this land, which includes but is not limited to modern members.

**Bednar's Talk Genuinely Maps to the Warnings but Not Necessarily to the Timeline**

Philpot notes that Elder Bednar's [October 2024 talk](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2024/10/35bednar?lang=eng), "In the Space of Not Many Years," applied President Benson's Book of Mormon hermeneutic and drew a direct comparison between the Nephite pride cycle and our day. Bednar's key quote: "All these iniquities did come unto them in the space of not many years" ([Helaman 6:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p32#p32)).

Bednar's talk genuinely supports the *pattern* Philpot describes — that the Book of Mormon was "written for our day" and that the Nephite decline is a warning for modern Saints. Bednar explicitly said: "Please remember that the Book of Mormon looks to the future and contains important principles, warnings, and lessons intended for me and you."

But Bednar's application is *moral and spiritual*, not chronological. He warns against pride, prosperity-induced apostasy, and spiritual blindness. He does not suggest that the timeline of Nephite events maps to specific modern years. Philpot takes Bednar's qualitative warning and imports it into a quantitative framework — a category shift that Bednar himself does not make.

### Out of Line

**Date-Setting: 2029 Assassination, 2030 Secession, 2033 Destruction**

This is where the presentation's speculative framework becomes most problematic. The specific claims:

- 2028: Most contentious election ever
- 2029: President assassinated (mapping to Laconius in 3 Nephi)
- 2030–2031: Secession crisis; states divide into tribes
- 2032: Failed reunification attempt
- 2033: Great destruction (3 Nephi 8), followed by Christ's visit

These predictions assign specific calendar years to future events based entirely on the Book of Mormon timeline parallel established in earlier phases. The Lord Himself has spoken directly on this matter:

> "I, the Lord God, have spoken it; but the hour and the day no man knoweth, neither the angels in heaven, nor shall they know until he comes." ([D&C 49:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49?lang=eng&id=p7#p7))

This is not ambiguous. The Lord says not only that no one *currently* knows the timing, but that they *shall not know until he comes*. This means no calculation — however elegant, however many scriptural parallels it draws upon — can determine the date of Christ's return or the events immediately preceding it.

Philpot acknowledges this is "theoretical" and "a likening exercise," but the specificity of his datings (April-October 2029 for the assassination, "the 34th year which is 2033" for the destruction) goes far beyond likening. Likening asks "what principle do I learn?" Date-setting asks "when exactly will this happen?" Jesus taught that even the angels don't know the answer to the second question.

The danger is real: Philpot describes people hearing prophetic urgency and responding with "I got to build a bunker. I got to get off grid." When specific dates are attached to cataclysmic events, some people will make extreme decisions that harm their families — selling property, moving impulsively, withdrawing from community life. The Lord's remedy for this is deliberately non-specific: "Stand ye in holy places, and be not moved" ([D&C 87:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/87?lang=eng&id=p8#p8)) — not "be in Missouri by 2033."

**The Political Commentary Overwhelms the Scriptural Analysis**

In Part III, the presentation drifts heavily into political speculation: corporate structures, tax-exempt status, Trump as Laconius, California vs. Texas secession, Bolton and Comey indictments as a ladder to Jacob. This political mapping occupies the majority of the transcript from the 0:00 to 25:00 timestamps.

The problem is twofold:

1. **Specificity locks the interpretation to the moment.** Mapping specific politicians to Book of Mormon characters creates a brittle framework that becomes obsolete as political landscapes shift. If Trump or his successor is *not* assassinated in 2029, does the entire Book of Mormon parallel collapse? It shouldn't — because the *principle* (that Gadianton robbers work secretly in governments) is true independent of any specific political mapping.

2. **The Book of Mormon's strength is its principles, not its calendar.** Mormon abridged a thousand years of history into our book. He chose what to include based on eternal patterns, not to give us a decoder ring for CNN. Elder Bednar's reading is the correct hermeneutic: "Why did the Lord inspire Mormon to include this account? What lesson can I learn?" — not "Which modern politician does this match?"

**Polar Shift / Supervolcano / Nuclear Speculation**

The transcript ventures briefly into speculative physical mechanisms for 3 Nephi 8's destruction: polar shifts, supervolcanoes, Russian ICBMs, Chinese hypersonic missiles. This material is entirely speculative and has no scriptural foundation. The scriptures describe *what* happens (tempest, earthquake, fire, darkness), not *how* it happens mechanistically. Filling in the mechanism with geopolitical or geological theories adds nothing to understanding and risks distracting from the spiritual preparation the Lord commands.

---

## Step 4: Missed the Mark

**Corporate Critique Overpowers the Spiritual Message**

Philpot spends significant time arguing that corporate legal fiction is a form of Gadianton culture, that the Church's 501(c)(3) status is a vulnerability, and that tax-exempt status could be revoked in a crisis. Some of these observations have real-world basis — legal structures do create dependencies. But the spiritual application gets lost in the political argument.

The Book of Mormon's warning about secret combinations is not primarily about corporate legal structures; it's about hearts. Helaman 6:21 says the Gadianton robbers "did have their signs, yea, their secret signs, and their secret words; and this that they might distinguish a brother who had entered into the covenant." The covenant was to protect wickedness, not a corporate charter. When Philpot maps this to corporate law, he obscures the simpler and more personally applicable warning: are *you* participating in systems designed to insulate people from moral accountability?

**Temple Eschatology Gets Muddled**

The discussion of whether temples will be relevant post-destruction and whether "there will be no temple there because Christ is the temple" (citing Revelation 21–22) conflates two distinct doctrinal categories: the operational temples where ordinances are performed, and the millennial presence of Christ as the living temple. President Nelson — in his final talk — announced 17 new temples and said "regular worship in the temple will help us" prepare for the Second Coming. The prophet's emphasis is on *going to the temple now*, not on speculating about whether temples will exist after the Second Coming.

---

## Step 5: Missed Opportunities

**Helaman 14:30–31 — The Agency Sermon That Completes Samuel's Signs**

Immediately after Samuel gives his signs of Christ's death (earthquakes, darkness, tempests), he delivers one of the most powerful statements on moral agency in all scripture:

> "Whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it unto himself; for behold, ye are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free." ([Helaman 14:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14?lang=eng&id=p30#p30))

This is crucial context that Philpot skips. Samuel's signs are not given to create a countdown clock — they are given so people can *choose*. The signs serve agency: "He hath given unto you that ye might know good from evil, and he hath given unto you that ye might choose life or death" (v.31). The purpose of prophetic knowledge is not panic but preparation through righteous choice.

**D&C 107:56 — Adam Prophesied What Should Befall His Posterity**

D&C 107:53–56 describes Adam's council at Adam-ondi-Ahman, where "Adam stood up in the midst of the congregation; and, notwithstanding he was bowed down with age, being full of the Holy Ghost, predicted whatsoever should befall his posterity unto the latest generation." Verse 57 adds: "These things were all written in the book of Enoch, and are to be testified of in due time."

This passage is far more significant for the Adam-ondi-Ahman doctrine than Philpot's olive-harvest symbolism. It tells us that Adam himself prophesied the entire future of his posterity — including the last days. And D&C 116 says he "shall come to visit his people" in that same location. The *scriptural* basis for a future gathering at Adam-ondi-Ahman is this passage, not a typological connection to olive oil and temple anointing.

**Daniel 7:9–14 — The "Ancient of Days" Connection to D&C 116**

D&C 116's footnote points directly to [Daniel 7:13–14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/7?lang=eng&id=p13-p14#p13), where the "Ancient of days" (Adam) sits, and "one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days." This is the scriptural basis for the future Adam-ondi-Ahman gathering — Adam sits in council and the Son of Man comes. The presentation could have strengthened its Adam-ondi-Ahman claims enormously by building from Daniel 7 rather than from olive harvest typology.

**D&C 87:8 — The Lord's Own Application of All These Signs**

Across this entire nine-phase presentation, one verse deserves to be the capstone, and it appears in the same revelation that prophesied "war poured out upon all nations":

> "Wherefore, stand ye in holy places, and be not moved, until the day of the Lord come; for behold, it cometh quickly, saith the Lord." ([D&C 87:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/87?lang=eng&id=p8#p8))

This is the Lord's own response to every sign, every pattern, every timeline, and every warning in this presentation. Not "calculate the dates." Not "identify the politicians." Not "build a bunker." **Stand in holy places and be not moved.** The solution to prophetic anxiety is not more data — it's deeper faithfulness. This verse should be the conclusion of the entire series, and it barely appears.

---

## Step 6: Overall Assessment

Phase 9 is the most uneven section of the presentation: it contains the strongest linguistic work (Kokaubeam / kōwḵāḇ) and the weakest analytical claims (specific date-setting for 2029–2033) side by side.

**The Good:** The Hebrew word study connecting Numbers 24:17 through Abraham 3:13 to Helaman 14:5 is the best original research in any phase — it follows the text carefully, uses Restoration scripture to illuminate biblical vocabulary, and asks a genuinely interesting question about the nature of Samuel's "new star." The storm/tempest distinction in 3 Nephi 8 is similarly careful textual work. Nelson's urgency is correctly identified as unprecedented. And the Alma 32 Zoramite parallel to COVID — God using disruption to humble and redirect His people — provides a faithful lens that avoids the false dichotomy between "COVID was punishment" and "COVID was meaningless."

**The Problematic:** The specific future timeline (2028 election → 2029 assassination → 2030 secession → 2033 destruction) violates D&C 49:7 in principle. The Lord says the timing "no man knoweth." No amount of clever scriptural parallelism overrides the Lord's own declaration. The political speculation (Trump as Laconius, Bolton/Comey indictments as evidence of Gadianton prosecution) imports Fox News commentary into scripture study and will age poorly. The polar shift and nuclear war speculation is entirely untethered from revelation.

**The Pattern Across All Nine Phases:** The presentation is strongest when it makes *observational* claims (historical parallels, linguistic connections, prophetic language analysis) and weakest when it makes *predictive* claims (specific dates, specific political identities, specific physical mechanisms). This is not a failure of the presenter's intelligence or sincerity — it's a structural feature of the difference between studying God's patterns and predicting God's calendar.

The prophets teach readiness, not chronology. Elder Bednar's hermeneutic — "Why did the Lord inspire Mormon to include this?" — always leads to preparation. Philpot's hermeneutic — "When exactly will this be fulfilled?" — sometimes leads to preparation but more often leads to calculation. The first approach keeps the reader in a position of humility; the second puts the reader in a position of apparent knowledge.

Stand ye in holy places, and be not moved.

## Become

### Truths to Apply

1. **The Kokaubeam framework enriches my reading of Helaman 14.** When Samuel says "a new star... such an one as ye never have beheld," reading it through Abraham 3:13 opens up a richer understanding of what "great lights" means in Restoration theology. I will look for how Abrahamic astronomical vocabulary illuminates other scriptural passages.

2. **Prophetic urgency is increasing and should be taken seriously.** President Nelson's final talk was entirely about the Second Coming. Elder Bednar warned that apostasy can happen "in the space of not many years." These are not routine conference themes — they represent an escalation in prophetic emphasis that I should respond to with deeper personal preparation.

3. **God uses disruption to humble and redirect.** The Alma 32 pattern — cast out of church, compelled to be humble, prepared to hear — maps beautifully to the COVID season. Fathers administered the sacrament. Families became the church in their homes. "Do ye suppose that ye cannot worship God save it be in your synagogues only?" ([Alma 32:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p10#p10)). This principle applies to future disruptions too: the Lord's plan includes seasons of difficulty that become seasons of growth.

4. **The Book of Mormon's value is in its principles, not its calendar.** Bednar's reading is the model: "What lesson can I learn from this to help me live in this day and age?" The Book of Mormon was written for me — not as a timeline decoder ring but as a pattern book for navigating the last days with faith, humility, and obedience.

### Warnings to Heed

1. **Date-setting is spiritually dangerous regardless of how clever the framework.** The moment someone says "I got to build a bunker" in response to prophetic speculation, the Spirit has been replaced by fear. The Lord's pattern is: give signs, warn to prepare, never specify dates. I should follow that pattern too.

2. **Political mapping makes scripture brittle.** The strength of 3 Nephi's Gadianton narrative is that it applies to *every* generation's corrupt elites, not just one party in one election cycle. Mapping secret combinations to specific politicians makes the application feel powerful in the moment but collapses when political landscapes shift.

3. **Speculation about physical mechanisms (polar shifts, nuclear war) is not revelation.** Scripture tells us *what* will happen; God has not revealed *how*. I should resist the temptation to fill the gaps with scientific or military speculation.

### Commitments

1. **Study Helaman 14 through the Abraham 3 lens** — re-read the chapter while cross-referencing the Abrahamic astronomical vocabulary. Look for how Kokaubeam, Kokob, Olea, and Shinehah might illuminate other celestial passages in scripture. *(By February 22, 2026)*

2. **Apply D&C 87:8 as my personal response to signs-of-the-times anxiety** — When I encounter prophetic speculation (dates, political mappings, doomsday scenarios), my response should be: "Stand ye in holy places, and be not moved." This means deepening temple worship, strengthening family worship, and maintaining community — not calculating, stockpiling, or fleeing. *(Ongoing)*

3. **Re-read Alma 32 in full** — The Zoramite pattern (cast out, humbled, prepared to hear) is a template for understanding disruption. I want to study this chapter carefully and trace the "compelled to be humble" principle through other Book of Mormon accounts. *(By February 15, 2026)*

## Transcript Review Notes

*Added 2025-07-26 — Pass 10 of the systematic transcript review*

### Overall Assessment

Phase 9 is the **second-best-captured phase** after Phase 4. The evaluation correctly sourced most Key Claims from transcript timestamps rather than slides, and the 2025–2033 timeline, harvest framework, New Jerusalem analysis, and Out of Line critiques all target verbal content the audience actually heard. The evaluation quality is high.

However, the **"Two Great Lights" section that gives this phase its title is entirely slide-only.** The Kokaubeam / kōwḵāḇ word study (Key Claims 1–3) and the eclipse interpretation (Key Claim 5) — praised as "the best original research in any phase" — were never verbalized. Zero transcript hits for Kokaubeam, kōwḵāḇ, kokob, "great light," "two great," chiasmus, foreshadow, or eclipse across all three transcripts. Meanwhile, the verbally-delivered Zarahemla/Hemlah etymology (~57:54) — also a creative Hebrew word study linking to Salt Lake City's destruction — is NOT in the evaluation.

### Verbal-vs-Slide Mapping

| Key Claim | Verbal? | Slide? | Notes |
|-----------|---------|--------|-------|
| "Second Coming chiasmus foreshadowing" (Helaman 14) | ❌ | ✅ Slide 359 | Zero transcript hits for "chiasmus" or "foreshadow" |
| Hebrew kōwḵāḇ / Kokaubeam word study | ❌ | ✅ Slides 365–368 | Zero hits across all 3 transcripts |
| New star as "great light" (sun/moon category) | ❌ | ✅ Slides 364, 368 | Part of Kokaubeam complex; slide-only |
| Isaiah 13 / 3 Nephi 8 parallel | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ Slides 360–363 | 3 Nephi 8 destruction extensively verbal (~33:00); "Isaiah 13" not named verbally |
| 2017/2024 eclipses prophetically significant | ❌ | ✅ Slide 356 | Zero transcript hits |
| Assassination 2029 | ✅ Heavy | ✅ | "In 2029 Laconius 2 wins the election and they murder him" (~16:00) |
| Secession crisis 2030–2031 | ✅ Heavy | ✅ | "We have this massive secession crisis in 2030" (~25:19) |
| Destruction = 2033 / 3 Nephi 8 | ✅ Heavy | ✅ | "The Lord is coming to Adam in 2033" (~28:00); storm/tempest ~33:00 |
| Storm vs. tempest distinction | ✅ Heavy | ✅ | Extended Webster 1828 verbal analysis (~33:00) |
| Rev 14 grape harvest | ✅ | ✅ | "Let's go back to Revelation 14... It is time to reap" (~38:19) |
| Wedding at Cana | ✅ | ✅ | "This is the wedding at Canaa, the six barrels of wine" (~40:00) |
| New Jerusalem / seed of Joseph Smith | ✅ Heavy | ✅ | Extensive Ether 13 reading (~49:06–52:00) |
| Bednar alignment | ✅ | ✅ | "Did anybody listen to Elder Bednar's talk" (~20:00) |
| Nelson urgency | ✅ | ✅ | "'The Lord is urging me to tell you to prepare'" (~22:00) |
| God uses disruptive events / COVID | ⚠️ Brief | — | "What happened to people who fled to the temples...They were closed" (~58:55). Alma 32 pattern is evaluation construct |

**Summary:** 10 of 15 Key Claims are verbal, 4 are entirely slide-only (all from the "Two Great Lights" section), 1 is partially verbal. The evaluation's title comes from material the audience never heard.

### Verbal-Only Items Not in Evaluation

1. **Zarahemla / Hemlah / Dead Sea etymology** (~57:54): "It's called the Salt Lake. It's never called the Dead Sea. In Hebrew, it is the sea of Heala... Zahhemlah. What does the Lord do to Zarahemla? Burns it. What's the modern Zarahemla?" Points to Salt Lake City as a type of Zarahemla. Creative Hebrew word study parallel to the slide-only Kokaubeam work.

2. **Oaks' first talk analysis** (~22:00–24:00): No temples announced; doubled down on family proclamation ("old school Mormonism"); John Taylor polygamy letter released; William Clayton journals upcoming; D&C 132 children's Come Follow Me. Substantial discussion of the new prophet's direction and its implications for the timeline.

3. **2500 at Bountiful = half of 5000 / half of 10 virgins** (~56:00–57:00): "Christ is with the 5,000... He is the temple. So if there's 2500 and Bountiful, there's half of the five parts that make it. Half the 10 virgins." Numerological connection between 3 Nephi 17 and the parable of the virgins.

4. **Creation week / "first month, fourth day" = creation day 4** (~33:00): "Mormon is very precise about this date... The fourth day of the creation story is the day in which the sun is created... Christ has to die before the end of the fourth day because on the fifth day the beasts of the sea are created. The beast will rise out of the sea on the beginning of the fifth day." Links 3 Nephi 8:5 to creation week typology and Passover week.

5. **Temple ceremony changes as prophetic signs** (~42:27): "The women go to the wedding they pull off their veil and they don't put it back on... you've switched the robes... the work has been hastened... the temple ceremony has been shortened and made so clear nobody can mistake it." Temple ordinance changes referenced as evidence of prophetic timeline acceleration.

6. **Abinadi / ten commandments / public schools** (~46:00–49:00): Extensive cultural critique connecting Abinadi's confrontation in Mosiah with modern education: "We teach our children in our public schools to break all of the ten commandments." Argues public schooling trains children in covetousness and fidelity to Babylon.

7. **"Third vs. totality" framework** (~53:00): "John the Revelator has two types. He's got the third and the total. So if you see anything in a third, it is not the totality. So John promises all of us that we will get the totality. Whereas the Nephites only got the third." Interpretive key for Revelation's proportional language.

8. **Corporate church dissolution in millennium** (~55:11–57:00): "Do you really think they're going to reinitiate the corporation of the first presidency in the millennium?... So what has to happen to the corporation? It has to go away." Extended Q&A about corporate structures dissolving.

9. **Bountiful as Passover/Sukkot gathering place** (~57:00): "I suspect they're going to Bountiful because that's the place that they go to for conference or their Passover feast or their soot [sukkot]."

10. **"I invite all of you to be crazy with me"** (~44:00): Personal vulnerability and invitation. "I drank the Kool-Aid and jumped to the deep end... I invite all of you to be crazy with me."

### Key Finding: Title/Content Irony

The evaluation is titled "The Two Great Lights & Culmination" and praises the Kokaubeam word study as "the best original research in any phase." But the entire "Two Great Lights" section (slides 356–369) — the Kokaubeam/kōwḵāḇ connection, the chiasmus foreshadowing, the eclipses — is **entirely slide-only**. The audience never heard this argument. It exists only on the presenter's visual aids.

Meanwhile, the verbal Hebrew word study the audience *did* hear — Zarahemla/Hemlah/Dead Sea etymology pointing to Salt Lake City's destruction — is not even mentioned in the evaluation. The Oaks analysis, creation-week/3 Nephi 8:5 connection, and temple ceremony changes as prophetic signs are all verbal-only content that goes unevaluated.

The evaluation remains strong for what it covers — especially the 2025–2033 timeline critique, the harvest framework analysis, the Missed Opportunities section, and the "Stand ye in holy places" capstone. The verbal-vs-slide gap is narrower than Phases 2–3, 5, or 8, but the irony that the evaluation's *headline feature* was never spoken aloud is notable.
