## Summary

This is the longest phase and the most politically charged. Pickering introduces Itamar Ben Gvir, Israel's Minister of National Security, who prayed on the Temple Mount during Hanukkah 2024 — an act Pickering identifies as the *start* of Daniel's 2,300-day countdown. The phase then covers Ben Gvir's policy change (allowing Jewish prayer on the Temple Mount), Jerusalem Day celebrations, the red heifer rehearsal at Shiloh, the underground tour beneath Temple Mount (Solomon's Stables), the Ark of the Covenant under the crucifixion site (Ron Wyatt), and a Palestinian security chief's perspective on these events. Pickering also distinguishes the red heifer (a purification offering) from the daily sacrifice, distinguishes Daniel (about Jerusalem) from the Book of Mormon (about us), and warns against replacement theology.

## Scriptures Cited — Verified

### Daniel 8:13-14 — The 2,300 Days

> "How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed." — [Daniel 8:13-14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/8?lang=eng&id=p13-p14#p13)

**Pickering's use:** Ben Gvir's Hanukkah 2024 prayer on the Temple Mount = the starting point of the 2,300 days. "This is the 2,300-day start of Daniel."

**Critical problem:** The text says "the vision concerning the **daily sacrifice**." The Hebrew word is *tamid* (תָּמִיד) — the daily offering described in [Exodus 29:38-42](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/29?lang=eng&id=p38-p42#p38): "two lambs of the first year day by day continually." This is not prayer. It's the *tamid*, the twice-daily burnt offering of a lamb upon the altar.

Pickering redefines "daily sacrifice" as "daily prayer" to make Ben Gvir's prayer fit. But the text is specific: the vision concerns the daily *sacrifice* (animal offering on an altar) and the *sanctuary* (the physical temple). Ben Gvir praying on the Temple Mount — while historically significant — is not the reinstating of the *tamid*. There is no altar, no priesthood service, no lamb.

### Isaiah 56:7 — House of Prayer for All People

> "Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people." — [Isaiah 56:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/56?lang=eng&id=p7#p7)

**Pickering's use:** This is the vision of what the Temple Mount should become — a house of prayer for all people, not exclusive. Jewish prayer returning to the mount fulfills this trajectory.

**Evaluation:** Note what this verse *actually says*: "their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar." Even in the "house of prayer" passage, the burnt offerings and sacrifices are integral. The vision isn't just prayer — it's full temple worship. Pickering uses the "prayer" part while the verse itself couples prayer inseparably with sacrifice.

### Numbers 19 — The Red Heifer Ordinance

> "This is the ordinance of the law which the Lord hath commanded… Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke." — [Numbers 19:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/19?lang=eng&id=p2#p2)

**Pickering's distinction (correct):** The red heifer is a purification/cleansing ordinance, not the daily sacrifice. It's burned *outside the camp* (v. 3), its ashes are used for the "water of separation" (v. 9), which ceremonially cleanses people from contact with death (v. 11-13). This is *not* the *tamid* (daily offering) and is not performed on the altar.

**Evaluation:** Pickering is right to distinguish the red heifer from the daily sacrifice. Many popular commentators conflate them. The red heifer rehearsal at Shiloh is a purification preparatory step — interesting as a sign that Israel is thinking about temple operations — but it's not the daily sacrifice of Daniel 8.

## Scriptures Not Cited but Relevant

### Exodus 29:38-42 — The Daily Sacrifice (Tamid)

> "Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually. The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even." — [Exodus 29:38-39](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/29?lang=eng&id=p38-p39#p38)

This is the *tamid* — the daily perpetual offering that Daniel 8:11-13 refers to when it says "the daily sacrifice was taken away." It requires:
- An altar (v. 42 — "at the door of the tabernacle")
- A lamb (v. 38 — "two lambs")
- Flour, oil, and wine (v. 40)
- Priestly function (implied)

None of these elements are present in Ben Gvir's prayer. The *tamid* is the specific ordinance Daniel's vision tracks; its removal and restoration frame the 2,300 days.

### 3 Nephi 20:29-34 — Jerusalem Restored

> "And I will remember the covenant which I have made with my people; and I have covenanted with them that I would gather them together in mine own due time, that I would give unto them again the land of their fathers for their inheritance, which is the land of Jerusalem, which is the promised land unto them forever, saith the Father." — [3 Nephi 20:29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/20?lang=eng&id=p29#p29)

Christ Himself prophecies the gathering of Israel back to Jerusalem. This is the proper prophetic framework for understanding what's happening in Israel — covenant fulfillment, not date calculation. Verses 30-31 are especially important: "the time cometh, when the fulness of my gospel shall be preached unto them; and they shall believe in me, that I am Jesus Christ." The endpoint is belief in Christ, not geopolitical maneuvering.

### 3 Nephi 16:10-15 — The Gentile Warning

> "At that day when the Gentiles shall sin against my gospel, and shall reject the fulness of my gospel, and shall be lifted up in the pride of their hearts above all nations... if they shall do all those things, and shall reject the fulness of my gospel, behold, saith the Father, I will bring the fulness of my gospel from among them." — [3 Nephi 16:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/16?lang=eng&id=p10#p10)

Christ warns that Gentile nations (including ours) who receive the gospel and then reject it will lose it. The condition isn't geopolitical — it's spiritual: pride, lying, hypocrisy, priestcraft. This is the scriptural lens for evaluating America's trajectory, not Daniel's numerical calculations.

## The 2,300-Day Start: An Evaluation

Pickering's central claim in this phase is that Ben Gvir praying on the Temple Mount at Hanukkah 2024 = the start of the 2,300 days of Daniel 8:14. Let's test this against Daniel's own text:

**Daniel 8:11-14 says:**
1. The daily *sacrifice* (tamid) is taken away (v. 11)
2. The *sanctuary* is cast down (v. 11)
3. An host is given against the daily *sacrifice* by reason of transgression (v. 12)
4. How long until the *sanctuary* is cleansed? (v. 13)
5. Answer: 2,300 days (v. 14)

**What Ben Gvir did:**
1. Prayed on the Temple Mount (no sacrifice offered)
2. Changed police policy (political, not priestly)
3. The sanctuary doesn't exist yet (no temple, no altar)

The fit requires redefining "daily sacrifice" as "daily prayer" and "sanctuary" as "Temple Mount platform." These are substantial redefinitions, not minor adjustments. Daniel is specifically asking about the *tamid* — the daily lamb offering that was the heartbeat of temple worship. Prayer is wonderful. It is not the *tamid*.

**The deeper problem:** If you redefine the starting event loosely enough, you can make almost any significant Temple Mount event fit. A government policy change about prayer is real news — but it's a political event, not a liturgical one. The 2,300 days in Daniel are framed entirely around sacrificial worship and the sanctuary system.

## The Ron Wyatt Problem (Continued)

This phase doubles down on Ron Wyatt's claims:
- The Ark of the Covenant traveled through underground caverns to rest under the crucifixion site
- Christ's blood dripped down through a crack in the rock onto the Ark's mercy seat
- The rods "confirmed it all, including the tunnel"

Ron Wyatt (1933-1999) was a nurse anesthetist, not an archaeologist. His claims about the Ark, about Noah's Ark in Turkey, and about numerous other sites have been rejected by professional archaeologists across the board — including organizations sympathetic to biblical archaeology (Biblical Archaeology Review, Associates for Biblical Research). No independent researcher has verified any of his major claims. The "Garden Tomb" site (where Wyatt claimed to find the Ark) is administered by a Christian organization that has publicly distanced itself from his claims.

Pickering's response to skepticism is to invoke the dowsing rods: "the rods confirmed it all." But using one unverified methodology to validate another unverified claim doesn't strengthen either.

## The Replacement Theology Insight

One of Pickering's genuinely valuable contributions in this phase is his warning about replacement theology:

- Daniel is about Jerusalem and Judah — not about the LDS Church
- The Book of Mormon is about us — not about ancient Israel
- Don't confuse the two

This is sound hermeneutical principle. Many Latter-day Saint commentators read Daniel as if it's about the Church of Jesus Christ, when it's primarily about the literal nation of Judah, the literal temple, and the literal city of Jerusalem. The Book of Mormon addresses the Gentile nations and the remnant of Lehi's descendants. Keeping these distinct respects the text and avoids the self-centered reading that plagues both Protestant and LDS eschatology.

However, Pickering then falls into his own version of this error by reading *modern geopolitics* onto Daniel. Replacing "us" with "Ben Gvir" or "Trump" is still eisegesis — it's just different characters. Daniel's vision is about something much bigger than any current politician.

## Evaluation

### In Line

1. **Red heifer ≠ daily sacrifice.** Pickering correctly distinguishes the red heifer (Numbers 19, purification offering, burned outside camp) from the *tamid* (daily sacrifice, lambs on the altar). Many popular commentators get this wrong. This is good teaching.

2. **Something significant is happening in Israel.** Jewish prayer on the Temple Mount after decades of restriction is historically real and noteworthy. Whether or not it's the 2,300-day start, the political trajectory toward temple operations is observable.

3. **Replacement theology warning.** "Daniel is about Jerusalem, not us" is genuinely important and too rarely said in LDS end-times circles.

4. **The underground tour is remarkable.** The footage beneath Temple Mount — the Herodian arches, the 5-story depth, Solomon's Stables — is genuinely valuable historical documentation. This is the sort of thing Pickering's Israel trips actually contribute.

### Out of Line

1. **Redefining "daily sacrifice" as "prayer."** Daniel 8:11-14 is tracking the *tamid* — the twice-daily lamb offering. Ben Gvir's prayer, while politically significant, is not the *tamid*. You cannot start a 2,300-day countdown from an event that doesn't match Daniel's own terms.

2. **Ron Wyatt's Ark claim stated as near-fact.** "I truly believe" and "the rods confirmed it" doesn't constitute evidence. The claim that Christ's blood dripped onto the Ark of the Covenant through a crack in the rock is theologically dramatic but archaeologically unverified by anyone independent.

3. **"We didn't make up these numbers — Daniel did."** Actually, Daniel received numbers from Gabriel. What Pickering made up is the *starting date*. Gabriel did not say "the 2,300 days begin when an Israeli politician prays on Temple Mount during Hanukkah." Pickering chose the starting event and then attributes the calculation to divine authority.

4. **Political commentary as prophecy.** The extended discussion of Ben Gvir's political career, the hostage deal, his personality — this is Israeli politics, not scripture study. Attaching prophetic significance to a specific politician's prayer photo-op is newspaper eisegesis at its most direct.

### Missed the Mark

1. **Palestinian security chief interview without discernment.** The Palestinian official called Jewish worshippers "the cancer of the whole earth" and blamed them for October 7th. Pickering includes this footage without much pushback beyond "you see how much he believes his perspective." Including inflammatory rhetoric without clear refutation can normalize it.

2. **"We were the first group he took down there."** Pickering acknowledges this might not be true ("whether it's true or not, we don't know") but includes it anyway. Why? Because exclusivity sells tours.

### Missed Opportunities

1. **Malachi 3:1-4** — "The Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple... and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness." If you're going to talk about when sacrifices resume, this is the prophetic text: Christ Himself comes to the temple and purifies the priesthood *first*. The order matters.

2. **D&C 13** — The Aaronic Priesthood was restored to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery by John the Baptist in 1829. If there's going to be a valid daily sacrifice, it requires valid Aaronic priesthood authority. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints claims this authority. This is the elephant in the room that LDS end-times commentators consistently ignore.

3. **Hebrews 10:1-18** — "For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified" (v. 14). The New Testament explicitly states that Christ's sacrifice fulfills and supersedes the daily offering. What does a *resumed* tamid mean theologically when the Great and Last Sacrifice has already been offered?

## Become

**What truth can I apply?**
- The distinction between Daniel (Jerusalem/Judah focus) and the Book of Mormon (Gentiles/remnant focus) is genuinely helpful. Read each in its own lane.
- Red heifer ≠ daily sacrifice. File this distinction permanently.

**What warning should I heed?**
- "We didn't make up these numbers" is the most dangerous sentence in the presentation. Pickering *did* choose the starting date, the applicable event, and the interpretive framework. Attributing your own calculations to divine authority is exactly what D&C 49:7 warns against. The numbers are Daniel's; the application is Pickering's.
- Don't let fascinating footage (underground Temple Mount tours) substitute for rigorous exegesis.

**Specific commitment:**
Read [Malachi 3:1-4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/3?lang=eng&id=p1-p4#p1) and [Hebrews 10:1-18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/10?lang=eng&id=p1-p18#p1) — the Lord's own timeline for temple restoration and the New Testament's understanding of why the *tamid* was fulfilled. These are essential context for any discussion of resumed sacrifices.
