## Summary

This is the interpretive climax of the presentation. Pickering reads Daniel 9:27, identifies the Abraham Accords as the pre-existing covenant that will be "confirmed" when Turkey signs on, projects a peace treaty date of October 1, 2027, interprets Trump's role through the Cyrus typology (useful but not righteous), critiques Trump for calling prophets "philosophers" and claiming he can prevent Middle East prophecy, reinterprets Revelation 6's white horse as peace-by-treaty rather than military conquest, introduces Denver airport murals as prophetic imagery, and warns that America will face judgment before building New Jerusalem. He concludes with a call to repentance and trust in God over political solutions — his strongest spiritual message in the entire presentation.

## Scriptures Cited — Verified

### Daniel 9:27 — Confirm the Covenant

> "And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate." — [Daniel 9:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/9?lang=eng&id=p27#p27)

**Pickering's reading:**
- "Confirm" (not "make") implies the covenant already exists
- The Abraham Accords = the existing covenant
- Turkey signing on = the confirmation, triggering the final 7-year period
- October 1, 2027 = projected date (from his Daniel's numbers framework)
- "In the midst of the week" = abomination of desolation at the 3.5-year mark

**Evaluation:** The distinction between "confirm" (Hebrew: *higbir*, to strengthen/make strong) and "make" is linguistically valid. The word does imply reinforcing something that exists. However, identifying the Abraham Accords as *that* covenant is pure speculation. Daniel 9:24-27 is one of the most debated passages in all of biblical scholarship. The "he" in verse 27 could refer to the Messiah (v. 25-26), not the Antichrist — many scholars read v. 27 as Christ confirming the covenant through His ministry (~3.5 years) and causing sacrifice to cease through the atonement (the sacrifice becomes obsolete). Pickering assumes the futurist/dispensationalist reading without acknowledging alternatives.

The date of October 1, 2027 is a calculated date based on Pickering's framework, not on the text itself. Daniel 9 provides relative timeframes (70 weeks, 62 weeks, 1 week), but the starting point and precise calibration are human constructions.

### Isaiah 9:8-10 — The Harbinger

> "The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel. And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart, The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the sycomores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars." — [Isaiah 9:8-10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/9?lang=eng&id=p8-p10#p8)

**Pickering's use:** Via Jonathan Cahn's "The Harbinger" — the pattern of pride after judgment. America (like ancient Israel) responds to chastening not with repentance but with proud rebuilding: "the bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones." Trump's approach exemplifies this — "Make America Great Again" without a call to repentance.

**Evaluation:** The Isaiah passage is about the Northern Kingdom of Israel (Ephraim/Samaria), not America. But the principle is genuinely captured: pride in the face of divine correction leads to worse judgment. Verses 11-13 deliver the consequence: "Therefore the Lord shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him... For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the Lord of hosts." The application to America-as-Ephraim is typological, not exegetical — but the type is uncomfortably apt.

### Revelation 6:1-2 — The White Horse

> "And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals... And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer." — [Revelation 6:1-2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/6?lang=eng&id=p1-p2#p1)

**Pickering's interpretation:**
- The word "bow" (Greek: *toxon*) is the same root as the rainbow (covenant sign)
- No arrow is mentioned — it's not a weapon
- The white horse = peace by treaty, not military conquest
- This fits Trump as deal-maker bringing false peace

**Evaluation:** This is creative but linguistically strained. The Greek word *τόξον* (toxon) does primarily mean "bow" as in the weapon that shoots arrows. While the rainbow also uses a form of this word, the warrior context (crown, conquering) strongly favors the weapon interpretation. The absence of an arrow doesn't transform a bow into a covenant — ancient Near Eastern iconography regularly showed rulers with bows as symbols of royal authority. 

That said, the interpretation illustrates something true: false peace precedes real destruction. The second horse (v. 4) takes peace from the earth with a sword. The sequence — apparent peace, then war — is a biblical pattern (1 Thess 5:3: "when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh").

### D&C 76:75 — Terrestrial Kingdom

> "These are they who are honorable men of the earth, who were blinded by the craftiness of men." — [D&C 76:75](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng&id=p75#p75)

**Pickering's use:** Trump is a "terrestrial" person — honorable, well-intentioned, but blinded by craftiness and not converted to Christ. He's doing good but not godly good.

**Evaluation:** Using D&C 76 to classify living people's eternal destination is problematic. D&C 76 describes *final* states of glory after the resurrection and judgment. Calling someone "terrestrial" while they're still alive presumes a judgment that belongs to God alone. The insight that good intentions without spiritual conversion are insufficient is valid; the practice of assigning kingdom classifications to living individuals based on their public persona is not.

### Ether 2:12 — The God of This Land

> "Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ." — [Ether 2:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p12#p12)

**Pickering's use (via Rhonda):** America's conditionality — serve Jesus Christ or be swept off. The political solutions without repentance are insufficient because the covenant is with God, not with governments.

**Evaluation:** This is one of the strongest scriptural cards in the presentation. Ether 2:8-12 is unambiguous: the nations on this land prosper *only* by serving Christ. The conditional nature of the promise is emphatic — repeated three times in four verses (vv. 8, 9, 10). Pickering's application is sound: no treaty, no political movement, no economic program substitutes for national repentance. This is the rare moment where Pickering's message aligns perfectly with the scriptural text.

## Scriptures Not Cited but Relevant

### D&C 87 — Prophecy on War

> "Verily, thus saith the Lord concerning the wars that will shortly come to pass, beginning at the rebellion of South Carolina... And the time will come that war will be poured out upon all nations... And thus, with the sword and by bloodshed the inhabitants of the earth shall mourn." — [D&C 87:1-2, 6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/87?lang=eng&id=p1-p2#p1)

Joseph Smith received this prophecy on December 25, 1832 — a specific, dated, verifiable prophecy that was fulfilled. It ends with a commandment (v. 8): "Wherefore, stand ye in holy places, and be not moved, until the day of the Lord come." The Lord's instruction regarding coming apocalyptic events is not *calculate the timeline* — it's *stand in holy places*. This is the counsel Pickering's presentation systematically neglects.

### D&C 49:7 — No Man Knoweth

> "The hour and the day no man knoweth, neither the angels in heaven, nor shall they know until he comes." — [D&C 49:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49?lang=eng&id=p7#p7)

Already cited in Phase 1, but it applies even more pointedly here. Projecting "October 1, 2027" as the treaty date is exactly the kind of date-setting this verse prohibits. Pickering would say he's not predicting the Second Coming — just a treaty. But his framework *derives* from the Second Coming timeline (2,300 days from the end), making the disclaimer a distinction without a difference.

### 3 Nephi 16:10-15 — Gentile Warning

> "At that day when the Gentiles shall sin against my gospel, and shall reject the fulness of my gospel, and shall be lifted up in the pride of their hearts above all nations... I will bring the fulness of my gospel from among them." — [3 Nephi 16:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/16?lang=eng&id=p10#p10)

The Gentile warning is about pride, rejection of the gospel, and moral collapse — not about geopolitical alliances or treaty failures. America's danger isn't that Trump will broker the wrong deal; it's that the nation possessing the fulness of the gospel has become proud and is in danger of losing it. The repentance condition (v. 13) remains open: "But if the Gentiles will repent and return unto me, saith the Father, behold they shall be numbered among my people."

## The Trump-Cyrus Typology

Pickering's most nuanced argument in the entire presentation: Trump parallels King Cyrus of Persia.

**The type:** Cyrus conquered Babylon and decreed that the Jews could return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple ([2 Chronicles 36:22-23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/36?lang=eng&id=p22-p23#p22), [Ezra 1:1-4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezra/1?lang=eng&id=p1-p4#p1)). He was called God's "anointed" (*mashiach*) in [Isaiah 45:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/45?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) — the only Gentile ruler given that title. He was not a worshipper of Yahweh; he served Ahura Mazda (Zoroastrianism). But God used him to accomplish covenant purposes.

**Pickering's application:** Trump, like Cyrus, facilitates Jewish temple aspirations (Abraham Accords, moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights). Like Cyrus, he is not a converted worshipper of Christ. Like Cyrus, God can use him without endorsing him spiritually.

**Evaluation:** This is the most responsible thing Pickering says about Trump in the entire presentation. It avoids both uncritical worship and reflexive dismissal. The caution — "he's done tons of good, but America still isn't repenting" and "he can't save anybody" — is exactly right. The critique of Trump saying "we're not going to let that happen" about Middle East prophecy is sharp and perceptive: no human deal-maker overrides divine decree.

The weakness is that Pickering then builds *forward* from the typology into specific predictions (October 2027 treaty, Turkey signing), turning a helpful theological observation into a speculative timeline.

## Denver Airport Murals

Pickering shows Denver International Airport's controversial murals by Leo Tanguma and reads them as prophetic imagery: the twin towers falling, a plague, a Trump-like figure with a red tie brokering peace while weapons are beaten into plowshares, followed by a pastoral scene of reconciliation.

**Evaluation:** These murals are publicly viewable art commissioned in the 1990s. They depict themes of war, environmental destruction, and eventual peace. Reading a "young Trump" figure into a 1990s mural is classic *apophenia* — finding patterns in ambiguous visual data. The murals don't need to be prophetic art to be interesting art. Treating airport décor as prophetic text alongside Daniel and Revelation fundamentally confuses categories of evidence.

## Evaluation

### In Line

1. **"America still isn't repenting."** This is bluntly true and rarely said in conservative LDS circles. The call to repentance rather than political saviorism is the spiritual heart of the presentation.

2. **The Cyrus typology, properly bounded.** Acknowledging that God uses imperfect instruments without endorsing their righteousness is sound theology. "He can't save anybody" is the correct statement.

3. **"The only thing we can choose is to be on his team."** The closing call to covenant loyalty over political tribalism is the strongest spiritual message in the entire two hours.

4. **Ether 2:12 application.** Deploying the Book of Mormon's strongest national covenant passage — serve Christ or be swept off — is the exactly correct scriptural lens for evaluating America.

5. **Isaiah 9:8-10 as national pattern.** Whether or not you accept Cahn's "Harbinger" framework, the pattern of prideful rebuilding after divine correction (versus humble repentance) is a real and recurring biblical pattern.

### Out of Line

1. **October 1, 2027 as treaty date.** Setting specific future dates for prophetic events violates [D&C 49:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49?lang=eng&id=p7#p7). "If it's precisely on the date" is not a disclaimer — it's a hedge that preserves the prediction while providing deniability.

2. **Abraham Accords = Daniel 9:27 covenant.** This is newspaper eisegesis — reading current events into ancient text and calling it prophecy. The Abraham Accords are a 2020 diplomatic agreement between Israel, UAE, and Bahrain. Identifying this as the covenant of Daniel 9:27 (which scholars have debated for 2,000 years) based on pattern-matching is speculation presented as insight.

3. **Denver airport murals as prophecy.** Airport art is not scripture. Including it alongside Daniel and Revelation undermines the entire presentation's credibility.

4. **Classifying Trump as "terrestrial."** D&C 76 describes post-resurrection, post-judgment states. Assigning kingdom classifications to living people based on public behavior is not within any mortal's stewardship.

5. **"Visions of Glory" as supporting evidence.** Referencing an anonymously attributed personal vision (John Pontius's book, published 2012, attributed to "Spencer") as corroborating evidence for nuclear civil war is introducing apocryphal material as if it were prophetic canon. D&C 91 applies, but Pickering doesn't even acknowledge the need to apply it.

### Missed the Mark

1. **"There are great philosophers that said the world will end in the Middle East."** Pickering rightly catches Trump's error (calling prophets "philosophers") and draws a crucial insight: Trump doesn't know scripture. But Pickering then spends far more time on geopolitical speculation than on the scriptural reality that Trump doesn't know. If the prophecies are true, the right response is to teach them — not to speculate about which treaty will fulfill them.

2. **White horse = treaty.** The Greek doesn't support this reading, but the underlying insight (false peace precedes destruction) is biblically valid. It would have been stronger to cite [1 Thessalonians 5:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-thes/5?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) directly rather than forcing Revelation 6 into an unconventional reading.

### Missed Opportunities

1. **D&C 87:8 — "Stand ye in holy places."** The Lord's own instruction for living in prophetically volatile times is not to calculate the timeline but to stand in holy places and not be moved. This is conspicuously absent from a presentation obsessed with prophetic timelines.

2. **2 Nephi 28:31** — "Cursed is he that putteth his trust in man, or maketh flesh his arm." Pickering says this principle ("don't trust in Trump"), but the Book of Mormon says it more powerfully than he does. Let Nephi make the argument.

3. **D&C 121:33** — "How long can rolling waters remain impure? What power shall stay the heavens? As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the Missouri river in its decreed course... as to hinder the Almighty from pouring down knowledge from heaven." When Trump says "we're not going to let that happen," this verse is the scriptural answer. Pickering intuited the right response but didn't cite the scripture that says it perfectly.

## Become

**What truth can I apply?**
- America's security is conditional on covenant faithfulness, not political strategy. Ether 2:12 leaves no room for national pride divorced from national repentance.
- "He can't save anybody" — no political figure replaces Christ. File this permanently.
- The Cyrus pattern (God using imperfect instruments) is a model for how to think about political leaders in all eras, not just this one.

**What warning should I heed?**
- October 1, 2027. Write this date down. When it passes and the Abraham Accords have not been confirmed by Turkey as a Daniel 9:27 covenant, observe carefully how Pickering recalibrates. Every date-setter eventually faces this moment. The question is whether they repent of the practice or adjust the math.
- Denver airport murals are not scripture. When a presenter treats airport art and Daniel 9 with comparable seriousness, the discernment filter is not calibrated correctly.

**Specific commitment:**
Read [D&C 87](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/87?lang=eng) in full — a *fulfilled* prophecy given by a *true* prophet with a *specific* timeline that came to pass. Compare Joseph Smith's prophetic methodology (concise, given by revelation, verified by events) with Pickering's (elaborate, calculated from dates, projected into the future). The contrast is instructive.
