# Secret Combinations: From Cain to the Dragon

A study tracing the thread of secret combinations from the first murder through the Gadianton robbers, the beasts of Revelation, and into modern prophetic warnings about their influence today.

---

## The Pattern: Murder to Get Gain

The defining formula of every secret combination is strikingly simple: **murder and get gain**. It's a covenant with Satan rather than with God — sworn in secrecy, enforced by oaths of death, and designed to concentrate power while destroying freedom.

Every instance follows the same pattern:
1. **Satan initiates** — he approaches individuals already inclining toward wickedness
2. **Oaths of secrecy** — participants swear to protect each other's crimes
3. **Murder for gain** — violence becomes the instrument of acquiring power and wealth
4. **Destruction of freedom** — secret combinations "seeketh to overthrow the freedom of all lands, nations, and countries" ([Ether 8:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p25#p25))

---

## Part 1: The Origin — Cain and Master Mahan (Moses 5)

The first secret combination didn't form among strangers. It formed in the first family.

### The Covenant with Satan

> "And Satan said unto Cain: **Swear unto me by thy throat**, and if thou tell it thou shalt die; and swear thy brethren by their heads, and by the living God, that they tell it not; for if they tell it, they shall surely die; and this that thy father may not know it; and this day I will deliver thy brother Abel into thine hands." — [Moses 5:29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng&id=p29#p29)

> "And Satan sware unto Cain that he would do according to his commands. And **all these things were done in secret**." — [Moses 5:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng&id=p30#p30)

### Master Mahan

> "And Cain said: Truly I am **Mahan, the master of this great secret**, that I may **murder and get gain**. Wherefore Cain was called Master Mahan, and he gloried in his wickedness." — [Moses 5:31](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng&id=p31#p31)

The title "Master Mahan" becomes the signature designation — the master of the secret that murder can be exchanged for gain. Cain gloried in it. This is the opposite of sacrifice, where we give up something precious to God. In secret combinations, others are sacrificed to self.

### The Spread Through Lamech

> "For Lamech having entered into a covenant with Satan, **after the manner of Cain**, wherein he became Master Mahan, master of that great secret which was administered unto Cain by Satan..." — [Moses 5:49](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng&id=p49#p49)

> "For, **from the days of Cain**, there was a secret combination, and their works were in the dark, and they knew every man his brother." — [Moses 5:51](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng&id=p51#p51)

The pattern was immediately institutionalized. It didn't die with Cain; it became a tradition passed down — a counter-priesthood, an anti-gospel of darkness.

---

## Part 2: The Jaredite Cycle (Ether 8–9, 13–14)

### Oaths Handed Down from Cain

The Jaredites carried these oaths across the ocean. Through Jared's daughter and Akish, the ancient pattern was revived:

> "And it came to pass that they formed a **secret combination, even as they of old**; which combination is most abominable and wicked above all, in the sight of God." — [Ether 8:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p18#p18)

> "And they were kept up by the power of the devil to administer these oaths unto the people, **to keep them in darkness**, to help such as sought power to gain power, and **to murder, and to plunder, and to lie**, and to commit all manner of wickedness and whoredoms." — [Ether 8:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p16#p16)

The oaths of Akish "were given by them of old who also sought power, **which had been handed down even from Cain**, who was a murderer from the beginning" ([Ether 8:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p15#p15)).

### The Result: Total Destruction

> "Because of the **secret combinations** of Akish and his friends, behold, they did overthrow the kingdom of Omer." — [Ether 9:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p1#p1)

By Ether 14, secret combinations fueled a civilization-ending war:

> "Now the brother of Shared, whose name was Gilead, also received great strength to his army, because of **secret combinations**." — [Ether 14:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/14?lang=eng&id=p8#p8)

The Jaredite nation destroyed itself entirely. Every man, woman, and child. Moroni recorded this as a witness and a warning.

---

## Part 3: Moroni's Warning to Us (Ether 8:22–26)

This passage is one of the most direct addresses to modern readers in all of scripture. Moroni breaks the fourth wall — he's speaking to *us*:

> "And whatsoever nation shall uphold such **secret combinations**, to get power and gain, until they shall spread over the nation, behold, **they shall be destroyed**; for the Lord will not suffer that the blood of his saints, which shall be shed by them, shall always cry unto him from the ground for vengeance upon them and yet he avenge them not." — [Ether 8:22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p22#p22)

> "Wherefore, **O ye Gentiles**, it is wisdom in God that these things should be shown unto you, that thereby ye may repent of your sins, and **suffer not that these murderous combinations shall get above you**, which are built up to get power and gain." — [Ether 8:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p23#p23)

> "Wherefore, the Lord commandeth you, **when ye shall see these things come among you** that ye shall **awake to a sense of your awful situation**, because of this secret combination which shall be among you." — [Ether 8:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p24#p24)

> "For it cometh to pass that whoso buildeth it up **seeketh to overthrow the freedom of all lands, nations, and countries**; and it bringeth to pass the destruction of all people, for it is built up by the devil, who is the father of all lies; even that same liar who beguiled our first parents, yea, even **that same liar who hath caused man to commit murder from the beginning**." — [Ether 8:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p25#p25)

Note the specificity: Moroni connects the modern threat directly back through the Jaredites, through Cain, all the way to Satan's initial deception in the Garden. **It's the same being, the same lie, the same combination.**

---

## Part 4: The Gadianton Robbers (Helaman–3 Nephi)

### Formation

The Gadianton band formed among the Nephites through political assassination:

> "Helaman did send forth to take this band of robbers and secret murderers, that they might be executed according to the law. But behold, when Gadianton had found that Kishkumen did not return he feared lest that he should be destroyed; therefore he caused that his band should follow him. And they took their flight out of the land..." — [Helaman 2:10-11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/2?lang=eng&id=p10-p11#p10)

### The Source Was Satan, Not Records

A critical detail: Gadianton's oaths didn't come from the plates of Ether that Alma had commanded his son to hide:

> "Now behold, those secret oaths and covenants **did not come forth unto Gadianton from the records** which were delivered unto Helaman; but behold, they were **put into the heart of Gadianton by that same being** who did entice our first parents to partake of the forbidden fruit." — [Helaman 6:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p26#p26)

> "Yea, **that same being who did plot with Cain**, that if he would murder his brother Abel it should not be known unto the world. And he did plot with Cain and his followers from that time forth." — [Helaman 6:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p27#p27)

> "And also it is that same being who put it into the hearts of the people **to build a tower** sufficiently high that they might get to heaven." — [Helaman 6:28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p28#p28)

This is important: Satan is the direct source. These oaths are not learned from books — they are inspired from below. Any people, in any era, can receive them fresh.

### Their Method: Infiltration and Corruption

The Gadianton robbers didn't just hide in mountains. They infiltrated government:

> "And behold, there were men who were judges, who also **belonged to the secret band of Gadianton**, and they were angry, and they cried out against him..." — [Helaman 8:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/8?lang=eng&id=p1#p1)

> "They did have their signs, yea, their **secret signs, and their secret words**; and this that they might distinguish a brother who had entered into the covenant, that whatsoever wickedness his brother should do he should not be injured by his brother, nor by those who did belong to his band..." — [Helaman 6:22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p22#p22)

When the righteous Lamanites discovered Gadianton robbers among them, they "did use every means in their power to destroy them" ([Helaman 6:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p20#p20)). But the Nephites upheld them.

### Giddianhi's Letter: A Masterclass in Manipulation

In [3 Nephi 3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/3?lang=eng), the robber leader Giddianhi issues a letter to the Nephite governor Lachoneus. It's a textbook example of intimidation wrapped in flattery:

> "Or in other words, yield yourselves up unto us, and unite with us and **become acquainted with our secret works**, and become our brethren that ye may be like unto us — **not our slaves, but our brethren** and partners of all our substance." — [3 Nephi 3:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p7#p7)

The appeal is always: *join us*, *you'll be partners*, *we're equals*. But the threat is: *or else*.

### The Nephite Victory — and Its Conditions

Lachoneus and his military leader Gidgiddoni gathered the people, repented, fortified, and the Lord delivered them:

> "And they did rejoice and cry again with one voice, saying: May the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, **protect this people in righteousness**, so long as they shall call on the name of their God for protection." — [3 Nephi 4:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p30#p30)

The Gadianton robbers were defeated — but only because the people **repented and gathered to God**. The robbers returned whenever the people returned to wickedness.

---

## Part 5: The Dragon and the Beasts (Revelation 12–13, 17)

John's Revelation gives the cosmic view of the same conflict.

### The Dragon: Satan Himself

> "And there was **war in heaven**: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven." — [Revelation 12:7-8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/12?lang=eng&id=p7-p8#p7)

> "And the great **dragon was cast out**, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which **deceiveth the whole world**: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him." — [Revelation 12:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/12?lang=eng&id=p9#p9)

The dragon is the same being who covenanted with Cain. He simply operates at a larger scale in Revelation — not whispering to individuals in fields, but empowering global structures.

### The Beast: Earthly Power Animated by the Dragon

> "And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw **a beast rise up out of the sea**, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy." — [Revelation 13:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/13?lang=eng&id=p1#p1)

> "And the **dragon gave him his power**, and his seat, and great authority." — [Revelation 13:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/13?lang=eng&id=p2#p2)

> "And they **worshipped the dragon** which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, **Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?**" — [Revelation 13:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/13?lang=eng&id=p4#p4)

> "And it was given unto him to **make war with the saints, and to overcome them**: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations." — [Revelation 13:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/13?lang=eng&id=p7#p7)

The pattern is identical to the Gadianton formula: **power derived from Satan, used to persecute the righteous, wielded through political/military authority, demanding worship/loyalty**.

### The Second Beast and Daniel's Fourth Beast

The second beast (Revelation 13:11) "had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon" — appearing righteous but sourced in evil. And Daniel 7 parallels this vision:

> "The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall **devour the whole earth**, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces." — [Daniel 7:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/7?lang=eng&id=p23#p23)

> "And he shall speak great words **against the most High**, and shall **wear out the saints** of the most High, and think to change times and laws." — [Daniel 7:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/7?lang=eng&id=p25#p25)

### The Whore of Babylon

> "And I saw the woman drunken with **the blood of the saints**, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus." — [Revelation 17:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/17?lang=eng&id=p6#p6)

Nephi's parallel vision names this clearly:

> "And it came to pass that I beheld that the **great mother of abominations did gather together multitudes** upon the face of all the earth, among all the nations of the Gentiles, **to fight against the Lamb of God**." — [1 Nephi 14:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14?lang=eng&id=p13#p13)

## Part 7: Modern Prophetic Warnings

### Doctrine and Covenants: Warning the Saints

> "And again, I say unto you that **the enemy in the secret chambers seeketh your lives**." — [D&C 38:28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38?lang=eng&id=p28#p28)

> "Ye hear of wars in far countries, and you say that there will soon be great wars in far countries, but **ye know not the hearts of men in your own land**." — [D&C 38:29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38?lang=eng&id=p29#p29)

> "...and this in consequence of that which is coming on the earth, and of **secret combinations**." — [D&C 42:64](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42?lang=eng&id=p64#p64)

### Ezra Taft Benson: The Book of Mormon Was Written for Our Day

President Benson repeatedly taught that the Book of Mormon's central warning about secret combinations was aimed directly at modern readers:

> "The Book of Mormon is the keystone of our religion... It was **written for our day**." — President Ezra Taft Benson, ["The Book of Mormon—Keystone of Our Religion," October 1986](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion?lang=eng)

In April 1972, Elder Benson gave a landmark address connecting the Book of Mormon's warnings about secret combinations directly to modern civic threats:

> "The downfall of two great American civilizations came as a result of **secret conspiracies** whose desire was to overthrow the freedom of the people. 'And they have caused the destruction of this people of whom I am now speaking,' says Moroni, 'and also the destruction of the people of Nephi.'" — Elder Ezra Taft Benson, ["Civic Standards for the Faithful Saints," April 1972](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1972/04/civic-standards-for-the-faithful-saints?lang=eng)

> "Now undoubtedly Moroni could have pointed out many factors that led to the destruction of the people, but notice how he **singled out the secret combinations** ... There is no conspiracy theory in the Book of Mormon — **it is a conspiracy fact**." — [ibid.](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1972/04/civic-standards-for-the-faithful-saints?lang=eng)

In October 1979, President Benson delivered "A Witness and a Warning," linking America's covenant destiny to prophetic warnings:

> "This consecrated land has been placed under the everlasting decree of God. ... 'Whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under heaven, **if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ**."' — President Ezra Taft Benson, ["A Witness and a Warning," October 1979](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1979/10/a-witness-and-a-warning?lang=eng)

> "Whenever the God of heaven reveals His gospel to mankind, **Satan, the archenemy to Christ, introduces a counterfeit**. ... It is well to ask, what system established **secret works of darkness** to overthrow nations by violent revolution?" — [ibid.](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1979/10/a-witness-and-a-warning?lang=eng)

### President N. Eldon Tanner

> "The reality of Satan and the power and influence he wields have been evident since that first temptation in the Garden of Eden. He influenced **Cain to slay his brother Abel**, which resulted in great suffering and sorrow. **The Book of Mormon is replete with examples** of the destruction of individuals and groups who refused to follow the teachings of the Lord and instead succumbed to the influence of Satan." — President N. Eldon Tanner, ["Thou Mayest Choose for Thyself," April 1973](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1973/04/thou-mayest-choose-for-thyself?lang=eng)

### Elder Dallin H. Oaks: Cain's Motive at the Headwaters of All Wickedness

> "**Cain set the pattern of the world.** Cain coveted the flocks of his brother Abel, and Satan showed him how to obtain them. ... Satan taught Cain that a man could get worldly wealth by **committing some evil against its owner**." — Elder Dallin H. Oaks, ["Brother's Keeper," October 1986](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1986/10/brothers-keeper?lang=eng)

> "The motive of Cain is **at the headwaters of wickedness**. Cain's sin was murder, but his motive was personal gain. That motive has produced all manner of wickedness, including murder, thievery, and fraud. That motive is also at work in the legal but immoral practices of those who **get gain by preying on the weaknesses or ignorance of their neighbors**. Always such activities involve Cain's ancient rationalization: 'Am I my brother's keeper?'" — Elder Dallin H. Oaks, ["Brother's Keeper," October 1986](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1986/10/brothers-keeper?lang=eng)

### President Gordon B. Hinckley: After September 11, 2001

In October 2001 General Conference — just weeks after the September 11 attacks — President Hinckley opened with ["The Times in Which We Live"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2001/10/the-times-in-which-we-live?lang=eng), directly connecting the terrorist attacks to the Book of Mormon's Gadianton pattern:

> "We of this Church know something of such groups. **The Book of Mormon speaks of the Gadianton robbers**, a vicious, oath-bound, and secret organization bent on evil and destruction. In their day they did all in their power, by whatever means available, to bring down the Church, to woo the people with sophistry, and to take control of the society. **We see the same thing in the present situation**." — President Gordon B. Hinckley, ["The Times in Which We Live," October 2001](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2001/10/the-times-in-which-we-live?lang=eng)

> "From the day of Cain to the present, **the adversary has been the great mastermind of the terrible conflicts** that have brought so much suffering. Treachery and terrorism began with him. And they will continue until the Son of God returns to rule and reign with peace and righteousness." — [ibid.](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2001/10/the-times-in-which-we-live?lang=eng)

> "Our safety lies in repentance. Our strength comes of obedience to the commandments of God. ... Are these perilous times? They are. But **there is no need to fear**. We can have peace in our hearts and peace in our homes." — [ibid.](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2001/10/the-times-in-which-we-live?lang=eng)

He closed that same conference with ["Till We Meet Again"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2001/10/till-we-meet-again?lang=eng), a prayer for the nation:

> "Our safety lies in the virtue of our lives. Our strength lies in our righteousness. **God has made it clear that if we will not forsake Him, He will not forsake us**." — President Gordon B. Hinckley, ["Till We Meet Again," October 2001](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2001/10/till-we-meet-again?lang=eng)

In April 2003, President Hinckley addressed the Iraq War in ["War and Peace"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2003/04/war-and-peace?lang=eng), tracing the conflict back to its heavenly origin and quoting Revelation 12:7-9, while honoring a fallen returned missionary Marine.

In April 2004, he reflected on the full sweep of the battle between good and evil in ["The Dawning of a Brighter Day"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2004/04/the-dawning-of-a-brighter-day?lang=eng):

> "**Evil was manifest early in this world when Cain slew Abel.** It increased until in the days of Noah, 'God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth.' ... But it is evident that **the contest between good and evil, which began with that war, has never ended**. It has gone on, and on, and on to the present." — President Gordon B. Hinckley, ["The Dawning of a Brighter Day," April 2004](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2004/04/the-dawning-of-a-brighter-day?lang=eng)

### Mormon's Prophecy to Our Day

> "And it shall come in a day when the **blood of saints shall cry unto the Lord**, because of **secret combinations and the works of darkness**." — [Mormon 8:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/8?lang=eng&id=p27#p27)

Mormon is describing the day when the Book of Mormon would come forth — **our day**.

## Part 8: Characteristics of Secret Combinations (A Pattern for Recognition)

Drawing from all the scriptural accounts, secret combinations share these traits:

### 1. **Secrecy** — Oaths, signs, and secret words
- [Moses 5:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) — "All these things were done in secret"

## Part 9: The Remedy

Every scriptural account also contains the cure:

### Repentance and Turning to God
> "Preach unto them repentance, and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ; teach them to humble themselves and to be meek and lowly in heart; **teach them to withstand every temptation of the devil**, with their faith on the Lord Jesus Christ." — [Alma 37:33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37?lang=eng&id=p33#p33)

### Teaching "An Everlasting Hatred Against Sin"
> "Trust not those secret plans unto this people, but **teach them an everlasting hatred against sin and iniquity**." — [Alma 37:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37?lang=eng&id=p32#p32)

### Gathering and Righteousness
The Nephites defeated the Gadianton robbers in [3 Nephi 4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/4?lang=eng) because they:
- Gathered together in one body
- Stored food and supplies
- Repented and cried to God for deliverance
- Fought when necessary, but relied on divine protection

### Awareness — "Awake to a Sense of Your Awful Situation"
> "The Lord commandeth you, when ye shall see these things come among you that ye shall **awake to a sense of your awful situation**." — [Ether 8:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p24#p24)

### The Saints Will Prevail
> "And then cometh the battle of the great God; and the devil and his armies **shall be cast away into their own place**, that they shall not have power over the saints any more at all." — [D&C 88:114](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p114#p114)

> "These shall make war with the Lamb, and **the Lamb shall overcome them**: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful." — [Revelation 17:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/17?lang=eng&id=p14#p14)

## Reflections

The thread from Cain to Revelation is not a collection of disconnected stories. It's a single, continuous conflict. The same being (Satan), using the same method (oaths + murder for gain), attacking the same target (freedom and the saints of God), with the same result when tolerated (total destruction), and the same remedy (repentance, faith in Christ, gathering to God).

Moroni saw our day. He saw these combinations "among all people" ([Ether 8:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p20#p20)). He wrote Ether 8 as a deliberate warning to us — the Gentiles who would receive the Book of Mormon. His plea is urgent: don't let them get above you. Awake. The freedom of all nations is at stake.

The beasts of Revelation are the macro-view of what Cain started in a field. The dragon is the same whisperer who said "Swear unto me by thy throat." The scale changes; the source does not.
