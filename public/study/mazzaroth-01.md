# Celestial Scripture References: Stars, Heavens, and Times

*A comprehensive collection of scriptures and conference talks about the heavens, stars, moon, seasons, and appointed times.*

---

## Overview

This document gathers scripture references about celestial bodies—organized thematically for study. For the focused Mazzaroth study (Job 38:31-33 and celestial signs), see [mazzaroth.md](mazzaroth.md).

**Personal Note:** As a physics graduate with a love for astronomy, I find myself regularly looking at the stars. I cannot help but feel that God created them to paint a story that could have been read—a testimony written across the heavens.

## Part 1: God Knows and Names Every Star

### [Isaiah 40:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/40?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) — He Calls Them by Name
> "Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath **created** these things, that **bringeth out their host by number**: he **calleth them all by names** by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; **not one faileth**."

**Key insight:** Every star has a name known to God. None is forgotten. None fails.

### [Psalm 147:4-5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/147?lang=eng&id=p4-p5#p4) — Infinite Understanding
> "**He telleth the number of the stars**; he **calleth them all by their names**. Great is our Lord, and of great power: his **understanding is infinite**."

### [Psalm 8:3-4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/8?lang=eng&id=p3-p4#p3) — Wonder and Humility
> "When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the **moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained**; What is man, that thou art mindful of him?"

**Reflection:** The vastness of the heavens invites humility—yet God is mindful of us.

## Part 2: The Heavens Declare God's Glory

### [Psalm 19:1-6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/19?lang=eng&id=p1-p6#p1) — The Silent Witness
> "**The heavens declare the glory of God**; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. **Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.** There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard."

**Key insight:** The heavens testify universally—in every language, to every culture. Their witness transcends words.

### [Psalm 97:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/97?lang=eng&id=p6#p6)
> "**The heavens declare his righteousness**, and all the people see his glory."

### [D&C 88:42-47](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p42-p47#p42) — Witnesses of His Power
> "And again, verily I say unto you, he hath given a law unto all things, by which they move in their **times and their seasons**; And their courses are fixed, even the courses of the heavens and the earth, which comprehend the earth and all the planets... **Behold, all these are kingdoms, and any man who hath seen any or the least of these hath seen God moving in his majesty and power.**"

## Part 3: Named Constellations in Scripture

### [Job 38:31-33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/job/38?lang=eng&id=p31-p33#p31) — The Mazzaroth
> "Canst thou bind the sweet influences of **Pleiades**, or loose the bands of **Orion**? Canst thou bring forth **Mazzaroth** in his season? or canst thou guide **Arcturus** with his sons? Knowest thou the **ordinances of heaven**? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?"

**Hebrew terms:**
- **Mazzaroth** (מַזָּרוֹת) — The zodiacal constellations
- **Pleiades** (כִּימָה, *Kimah*) — "The seven stars"
- **Orion** (כְּסִיל, *Kesil*) — "The fool" or "the strong one"
- **Arcturus** (עָשׁ, *Ayish*) — Possibly the Bear constellation

### [Job 9:7-9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/job/9?lang=eng&id=p7-p9#p7) — God Commands the Stars
> "Which **commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars**. Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. **Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.**"

### [Amos 5:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/amos/5?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) — Seek the Maker
> "**Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion**, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: **The Lord is his name.**"

## Part 4: Abraham's Astronomical Revelations

### [Abraham 3:1-4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=p1-p4#p1) — Learning from the Urim and Thummim
> "And I, Abraham, had the **Urim and Thummim**, which the Lord my God had given unto me, in Ur of the Chaldees; And I **saw the stars**, that they were very great, and that one of them was nearest unto the throne of God... And the Lord said unto me: These are the **governing ones**; and the name of the great one is **Kolob**, because it is near unto me."

### [Abraham 3:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) — Hebrew Names for Celestial Bodies
> "And he said unto me: This is **Shinehah**, which is the sun. And he said unto me: **Kokob**, which is star. And he said unto me: **Olea**, which is the moon. And he said unto me: **Kokaubeam**, which signifies stars, or all the great lights."

### [Abraham 3:4-6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=p4-p6#p4) — Times and Seasons
> "And the Lord said unto me... Kolob was after the manner of the Lord, according to its **times and seasons in the revolutions thereof**; that one revolution was a day unto the Lord... it being one thousand years according to the time appointed... it is given unto thee to know **the times of reckoning, and the set time**."

## Part 5: Joseph's Dream — Sun, Moon, and Stars

### [Genesis 37:9-10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/37?lang=eng&id=p9-p10#p9) — The Celestial Prophecy
> "And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, **the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me**. And he told it to his father... and his father rebuked him, and said unto him... **Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?**"

**The interpretation:**
- **Sun** = Jacob (father)
- **Moon** = Rachel (mother)
- **Eleven stars** = Joseph's brothers

**Key insight:** This dream uses celestial imagery to represent family relationships—a prophetic picture fulfilled when Joseph's family bowed before him in Egypt ([Genesis 42](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/42?lang=eng)-[43](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/43?lang=eng)). The stars represent covenant family, foreshadowing Abraham's promise.

## Part 6: Lights for Signs and Seasons

### [Genesis 1:14-16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/1?lang=eng&id=p14-p16#p14) — The Purpose of Celestial Lights
> "And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to **divide the day from the night**; and let them be **for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years**."

### [Jeremiah 31:35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/31?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) — Ordinances of Moon and Stars
> "Thus saith the Lord, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and the **ordinances of the moon and of the stars** for a light by night."

### [D&C 121:30-31](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121?lang=eng&id=p30-p31#p30) — Knowledge Yet to Be Revealed
> "...if there be bounds set to the heavens or to the seas, or to the dry land, or to **the sun, moon, or stars**—All the **times of their revolutions**, all the **appointed days, months, and years**, and all their **glories, laws, and set times**, shall be revealed in the days of the dispensation of the fulness of times."

**Key insight:** God has promised to reveal astronomical knowledge in the latter days—the "glories, laws, and set times" of celestial bodies.

## Part 7: Stars as Symbol of Abraham's Seed

### [Genesis 15:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/15?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) — The Covenant Promise
> "And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and **tell the stars, if thou be able to number them**: and he said unto him, **So shall thy seed be.**"

### [Exodus 32:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/32?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) — Moses Remembers the Promise
> "Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, **I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven**."

### [D&C 132:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) — Continuation of the Promise
> "Abraham and his seed... should continue as innumerable as the stars."

### [Jeremiah 33:22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/33?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) — Innumerable
> "As the **host of heaven cannot be numbered**, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant."

---

## Part 8: Stars and the Morning of Creation

### [Job 38:4-7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/job/38?lang=eng&id=p4-p7#p4) — When the Morning Stars Sang
> "Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?... When the **morning stars sang together**, and all the **sons of God shouted for joy**?"

**Key insight:** The "morning stars" and "sons of God" are pre-mortal spirits—we were present at the creation, rejoicing together. This poetic imagery connects stars with spirit children.

### [Moses 1:33-35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng&id=p33-p35#p33) — Worlds Without Number
> "And **worlds without number have I created**; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only Begotten... **all things are numbered unto me**, for they are mine and I know them."

---

## Part 9: The Host of Heaven

### [Nehemiah 9:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/9?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) — Creator of All
> "Thou, even thou, art Lord alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with **all their host**, the earth, and all things that are therein... and **the host of heaven worshippeth thee**."

### [Moses 3:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/3?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) (Genesis 2:1) — Finished Creation
> "Thus the heaven and the earth were finished, and **all the host of them**."

### [Deuteronomy 4:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/4?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) — Warning Against Worship
> "And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even **all the host of heaven**, shouldest be driven to **worship** them."

**Caution:** While the heavens declare God's glory, they are to point us *to* God, not become objects of worship themselves.

### [1 Corinthians 15:41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p41#p41) — Differing Glories

### [D&C 88:87](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p87#p87) — Stars Exceedingly Angry
> "For not many days hence and the earth shall tremble and reel to and fro as a drunken man; and the sun shall hide his face, and shall refuse to give light; and the **moon shall be bathed in blood**; and the **stars shall become exceedingly angry**, and shall cast themselves down."

### [Isaiah 34:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/34?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) — Host of Heaven Dissolved

> "The earth rolls upon her wings, and the **sun giveth his light by day**, and the **moon giveth her light by night**, and the **stars also give their light, as they roll upon their wings in their glory**, in the midst of the power of God... **Any man who hath seen any or the least of these hath seen God moving in his majesty and power.**"
