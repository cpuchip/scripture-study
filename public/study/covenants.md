# Covenants: Relationship, Not Contract

*A study on the nature of covenants and how they build relationship with God*

---

## The Question

In Sunday School, someone asked: **"What is a covenant? Is it a contract?"**

A student responded: *"I view it more as a relationship with the Savior."*

That answer cuts to the heart of what distinguishes the wise virgins from the foolish. Both groups were covenant Israel. Both had made covenants. But only one group *knew* the Bridegroom—and He *knew* them.

Elder Pearson's haunting observation connects directly:

> "**Many leave the Savior and their covenants long before they leave His Church.**"
> — [Elder Kevin W. Pearson, October 2022](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/10/33pearson?lang=eng)

This is the crux: covenants are not merely *agreements* with God. They are the **means by which we come to know Him**—and by which He comes to know us.

---

## "Ye Know Me Not"

The most devastating phrase in the parable of the ten virgins is the bridegroom's response to the foolish virgins: *"I know you not"* ([Matthew 25:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/25?lang=eng&id=p12#p12)).

But Elder Bednar revealed something crucial from the Joseph Smith Translation:

> "The implications of this parable for each of us are expanded by another inspired revision. Importantly, the phrase 'I know you not,' as reported in the King James Version of the Bible, was clarified in the Joseph Smith Translation to **'Ye know me not.'**"
> — [Elder David A. Bednar, "If Ye Had Known Me," October 2016](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2016/10/if-ye-had-known-me?lang=eng)

The change is profound:
- **"I know you not"** — suggests rejection
- **"Ye know me not"** — reveals the *reason* for rejection: lack of relationship

The foolish virgins weren't strangers because the Bridegroom rejected them. They were strangers because **they never came to know Him**. Their covenants had become mere formality—contracts on paper, not living relationships.

## Contract vs. Covenant Relationship

| Contract | Covenant Relationship |
|----------|----------------------|
| Transaction-based | Relationship-based |
| "If you do X, I do Y" | "I bind myself to you" |
| Limited liability | Total commitment |
| Can be terminated | Designed to endure eternally |
| About exchange | About becoming |
| External compliance | Internal transformation |
| You remain separate | You become one |

President Johnson captured this distinction:

> "We are whole in Jesus Christ when we exercise our agency to follow Him in faith, submit our hearts to Him so He can change them, keep His commandments, and **enter a covenant relationship with Him**, meekly enduring and learning from the challenges of this earthly estate until we return to His presence."
> — [President Camille N. Johnson, April 2025](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/14johnson?lang=eng)

## How Each Covenant Builds Relationship with Christ

### 1. Baptism — Entering the Family

**The Covenant:** [Mosiah 18:8-10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18?lang=eng&id=p8-p10#p8)

Alma's baptismal covenant at the Waters of Mormon reveals what we promise:

> "As ye are **desirous to come into the fold of God**, and to be called his people, and are **willing to bear one another's burdens**, that they may be light; yea, and are **willing to mourn with those that mourn**; yea, and **comfort those that stand in need of comfort**, and to **stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places** that ye may be in, even until death..."
> — [Mosiah 18:8-9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18?lang=eng&id=p8-p9#p8)

**What We Promise:**
1. Come into the fold of God (family membership)
2. Be called His people (identity)
3. Bear one another's burdens
4. Mourn with those that mourn
5. Comfort those in need
6. Stand as witnesses of God always

**What God Promises:**
- Redemption
- Numbered among the first resurrection
- Eternal life
- His Spirit poured out upon us

**How It Builds Relationship:**
Baptism is *adoption* into God's family. We take upon us Christ's *name*—we become identified with Him. A contract says "I agree to terms." Baptism says "I become Yours."

The sacrament prayers ([D&C 20:77, 79](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20?lang=eng&id=p77#p77)) renew this weekly:
- We witness that we are **willing to take upon us His name**
- We commit to **always remember Him**
- We promise to **keep His commandments**
- We receive the promise: **always have His Spirit to be with them**

*Relationship application:* How often do I "take upon me His name" in my daily actions? Am I becoming identified with Christ in how I treat others?

---

### 2. Priesthood — The Oath and Covenant

**The Covenant:** [D&C 84:33-44](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p33-p44#p33)

> "For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the **magnifying their calling**, are **sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies**."
> — [D&C 84:33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p33#p33)

The priesthood covenant is unique because it involves an **oath**—God's solemn promise that He cannot break:

> "Therefore, all those who receive the priesthood, receive this **oath and covenant of my Father, which he cannot break**, neither can it be moved."
> — [D&C 84:40](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p40#p40)

**The Chain of Receiving:**
This is where the covenant becomes intensely relational:

> "And also all they who receive this priesthood **receive me**, saith the Lord; For he that receiveth my servants **receiveth me**; And he that receiveth me **receiveth my Father**; And he that receiveth my Father **receiveth my Father's kingdom**; therefore **all that my Father hath shall be given unto him**."
> — [D&C 84:35-38](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p35-p38#p35)

Notice the progression: receiving the priesthood → receiving Christ → receiving the Father → receiving everything the Father has.

This is not a transaction. This is **inheritance through relationship**.

**How It Builds Relationship:**
- The priesthood is the power by which God does His work
- To hold it is to be trusted with His authority
- To magnify it is to act *as He would act*
- We become His hands—and in doing so, we come to know His heart

*Relationship application:* When I serve in my priesthood calling, am I just fulfilling a duty, or am I learning to act as God would act?

### 3. Temple Initiatory — Washed, Anointed, Clothed

**The Covenant:** The initiatory ordinances

The [General Handbook](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/27-temple-ordinances-for-the-living?lang=eng) describes the initiatory as the first part of the endowment:

> "The endowment is received in two parts. In the first part, a person receives preliminary ordinances called the initiatory. The initiatory ordinances include being symbolically washed and anointed, as well as instruction on wearing the temple garment. It also includes special blessings related to the person's divine potential."

The initiatory involves:
- Being symbolically **washed** and **anointed**
- Receiving **blessings** related to our divine heritage and potential
- Being **clothed** in the garment of the holy priesthood

**How It Builds Relationship:**
- To be washed and anointed is to be *prepared* for God's presence—made clean and set apart
- The blessings speak to who we are and what we may become through faithfulness
- The garment is a constant reminder of covenants—we literally *wear* our relationship with God
- The garment, as the handbook notes, provides "greater access to the Savior's mercy, protection, strength, and power"

*Relationship application:* Does wearing the garment remind me daily of who I am becoming? Do I approach it as a sacred privilege or a mere obligation?

---

### 4. Temple Endowment — Power and Knowledge

**The Covenant:** Multiple covenants made in the endowment ceremony

The endowment is the second part of the temple ordinances (following the initiatory). The [official Church website](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/what-is-temple-endowment) explains:

> "In the second part, you will receive the rest of your endowment in a group setting... events that are part of the plan of salvation are presented. They include the Creation of the world, the Fall of Adam and Eve, the Atonement of Jesus Christ, the Apostasy, and the Restoration. You will also learn more about the way all people can return to the presence of the Lord."

The endowment includes covenants of:
- **Obedience** — striving to keep Heavenly Father's commandments
- **Sacrifice** — supporting the Lord's work; repenting with a broken heart
- **The Gospel** — faith, repentance, covenants, endurance, love of God and neighbor
- **Chastity** — fidelity in marriage
- **Consecration** — dedicating time, talents, and all we have to building up Christ's Church

**The Key Teaching:**

> "And this greater priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the kingdom, even **the key of the knowledge of God**. Therefore, **in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest**. And without the ordinances thereof, and the authority of the priesthood, **the power of godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh**."
> — [D&C 84:19-21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p19-p21#p19)

The ordinances *manifest the power of godliness*. They are not merely rituals—they are the means by which we learn to know God.

**How It Builds Relationship:**
The endowment:
- Teaches us who we are (children of Heavenly Parents)
- Teaches us where we came from (premortal existence)
- Teaches us why we are here (to be tested, to gain experience)
- Teaches us where we are going (return to God's presence)
- Teaches us *how to get there* (covenants, symbols, the Atonement)

Each covenant is a step closer to God. Obedience → Sacrifice → Gospel → Chastity → Consecration. We give more at each step. And in giving, we receive more of Him.

*Relationship application:* Do I approach temple worship as learning *about* God or learning to *know* God? Am I being transformed by the covenants I've made?

### 5. Sealing — Bound Together

**The Covenant:** [D&C 132:19-20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng&id=p19-p20#p19)

> "And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and by the new and everlasting covenant, and it is **sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise**, by him who is anointed... then shall it be written in the Lamb's Book of Life... and they shall pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there, to their **exaltation and glory in all things**..."
> — [D&C 132:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng&id=p19#p19)

**How It Builds Relationship with Christ:**
The sealing covenant binds husband and wife eternally—but notice: it is Christ's word, Christ's law, Christ's sealing power that makes it effective. We become bound to each other *through* Him.

This is why the temple sealing is an ordinance performed by priesthood authority—because eternal marriage is not just a human arrangement. It is a **covenant entered into with God** that happens to include your spouse.

Christ is not just a witness to the marriage. He is a *party* to the covenant.

**How It Improves Marriage:**
When both spouses are covenanting *with Christ* (not just with each other), everything changes:
- Conflict becomes about aligning with Him, not winning arguments
- Forgiveness becomes possible because Christ forgives both of us
- Growth becomes mutual because we're both becoming like Him
- Love deepens because we love what He loves in each other
- Unity increases because we're both pointing the same direction

*Relationship application:* Do I see my marriage as a covenant between my wife and me, or as a covenant between us and Christ? How would my daily interactions change if I remembered Christ is a party to our covenant?

## The Atonement: Making It All Work

You asked: *"How do I better apply the Atonement to make this all work?"*

The Atonement is not separate from covenant-keeping—it is what *makes covenant-keeping possible*.

### When We Fall Short

Every covenant includes the invitation to repent. The sacrament prayers don't say "who have perfectly kept His commandments." They say "that they are **willing** to take upon them the name of thy Son, and **always remember** him and **keep his commandments**."

Willingness. Remembrance. Effort.

The Atonement covers the gap between our willingness and our performance.

### How the Atonement Enables Relationship

**1. Forgiveness removes barriers**
Sin separates us from God. The Atonement removes that separation—not by ignoring our sins, but by transforming us through repentance.

**2. Grace provides enabling power**
The Atonement doesn't just forgive—it *strengthens*. "His grace is sufficient" ([2 Corinthians 12:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p9#p9)) means He gives us power to do what we cannot do alone.

**3. The Atonement transforms our nature**
The goal isn't just forgiveness—it's becoming. The mighty change of heart ([Alma 5:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&id=p14#p14)) makes us into people who *want* to keep covenants.

### Practical Application

When covenant-keeping feels overwhelming:
1. **Remember the weekly reset** — The sacrament renews all covenants. Every Sunday is a fresh start.
2. **Focus on willingness** — God knows your heart. If you're willing and trying, you're covenant-keeping.
3. **Accept grace** — The Atonement isn't plan B. It's the plan.
4. **Return to the temple** — Temple worship reminds us of our covenants and fills us with power.
5. **Pray for the gift** — "Pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love" ([Moroni 7:48](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7?lang=eng&id=p48#p48)).

## "Men Are That They Might Have Joy"

You quoted [2 Nephi 2:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p25#p25): "Men are that they might have joy."

This is not despite life's hardships—it is *through* them. Lehi says this in the context of explaining the Fall, opposition, and agency.

Covenants provide the framework for joy:
- **Identity** — We know who we are (children of God)
- **Purpose** — We know why we're here (to become like Him)
- **Connection** — We are not alone (bound to God and each other)
- **Hope** — We know how this ends (eternal life with family)

The ten virgins who had oil experienced joy when the Bridegroom came. The ones without oil experienced despair. The difference was preparation—but the *deeper* difference was relationship.

Those who *knew* Him were filled with joy.
Those who didn't know Him heard the devastating words: "Ye know me not."

## Questions for Reflection

1. **Contract or Relationship?** Do I approach my covenants as agreements to keep, or as a deepening relationship with Christ?

2. **Do I Know Him?** If Christ came today, would I recognize His voice? Would He recognize me as someone who has walked with Him?

3. **Sacrament Renewal:** When I partake of the sacrament, am I renewing a contract or reconnecting with a Person?

4. **Temple as Relationship:** When I attend the temple, am I "going through" the motions or "coming unto" Christ?

5. **Marriage Covenant:** How would I treat my spouse differently if I remembered Christ is a party to our covenant?

6. **The Atonement:** Am I trying to keep covenants in my own strength, or am I relying on His grace to transform me?

### On Taking Upon Us Christ's Name
- [Mosiah 5:7-12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5?lang=eng&id=p7-p12#p7) — "Ye shall be called the children of Christ... I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ"

Taking upon us Christ's name is more than a label—it is *identity*. We become His. This connects powerfully to the ten virgins: the wise virgins *knew* the Bridegroom because they had truly become His people. The foolish virgins had the name nominally but not relationally—"Ye know me not."
