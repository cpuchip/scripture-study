## Why This Talk?

This talk moved me deeply. The specificity of Elder Brown's testimony story, his vulnerability about peer persecution, and his urgent invitation create a powerful spiritual experience. This study examines *how* he teaches as much as *what* he teaches—using [Teaching in the Savior's Way](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teaching-in-the-saviors-way-2022?lang=eng) as the framework.

## Talk Overview

Elder Brown structures his message around **three powerful truths from the Restoration**:

1. **God Is Our Loving Heavenly Father** — omniscient, omnipotent, His nature is to bless
2. **Agency Is the Gift to Choose and Act** — paid for by Christ, a sacred responsibility
3. **Testimony Comes Through the Holy Ghost** — the preeminent witness, comes in many ways

He then shares his personal conversion story from Jamaica and teaches how to "take charge" of testimony using agency.

## Analysis: Teaching in the Savior's Way Principles

### 1. FOCUS ON JESUS CHRIST

#### "Teach about Jesus Christ No Matter What You Are Teaching"

| Manual Principle | How Elder Brown Illustrates It |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Connect every topic to Christ** | His topic is *testimony*—but he immediately grounds it in Christ: "a sure witness of Jesus Christ and His gospel" |
| **The Lawgiver, not just the laws** | His 3 doctrinal truths all point to divine beings who **act**: Father blesses, Christ paid the price, Holy Ghost witnesses |
| **Look for symbols** | His Sacred Grove becomes a **symbol**—Jamaica as his personal Palmyra: "Jamaica is to me like Palmyra was to Joseph Smith" |

#### "Help Learners Come unto Jesus Christ"

| Manual Principle | How Elder Brown Illustrates It |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Recognize the Lord's love, power, mercy** | [D&C 93:38](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng&id=p38#p38) — Christ's mercy applied to testimony: "God having redeemed man from the fall" |
| **Strengthen relationship with Godhead** | His framework connects testimony directly to all three members of the Godhead |
| **Help learners intentionally strive** | "Take charge of your testimony. Work for it. Own it. Care for it. Nurture it." Direct action verbs! |

---

### 2. LOVE THOSE YOU TEACH

| Manual Principle | How Elder Brown Illustrates It |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| **See learners as God sees them** | "Every son or daughter of God can gain a deeper, firmer, and surer knowledge" — he sees *everyone* as capable |
| **Understand their circumstances** | "Perhaps you have been asked some of these questions. Perhaps even now you are being bombarded as I was." — he enters their experience |
| **Create a safe environment** | His vulnerability about peer persecution creates safety: "It was painful, especially when it came from people I cared about" |
| **Express your love** | Direct address: "My dear brothers and sisters" / Names Sister Audrey Krauss: "I forever love her" |

---

### 3. TEACH BY THE SPIRIT

| Manual Principle | How Elder Brown Illustrates It |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Prepare yourself spiritually** | The talk itself is a product of his 40+ year spiritual preparation since that bathroom moment |
| **Create opportunities for learners to feel the Spirit** | His **sensory specificity** invites the Spirit: "Four Grove Road, Mandeville, Jamaica, in my bathroom, at 6:00 a.m. on a Wednesday" — the Spirit confirms truth through authentic detail |
| **Help learners recognize revelation** | "A testimony through the Holy Ghost can come in many ways. Like a light bulb... like the sunrise... like rays of light" — teaching HOW revelation works |
| **Bear testimony often** | Multiple testimony statements throughout: "I now know for myself" / "If you know, you know. I know that I know." |

**Key Insight:** The extraordinary specificity of his story isn't just good storytelling—it's an invitation for the Spirit to confirm authentic witness. When we hear "6:00 a.m. on a Wednesday," we *feel* that this is real.

### 4. TEACH THE DOCTRINE

| Manual Principle | How Elder Brown Illustrates It |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Learn the doctrine for yourself** | His 3-point structure IS doctrine: (1) God's nature, (2) Agency, (3) Holy Ghost — foundational truths |
| **Teach from scriptures and prophets** | 25+ scripture references / Quotes President Nelson 3 times / John Taylor & Parley P. Pratt story / [Joseph Smith—History 1:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) |
| **Focus on truths that lead to conversion** | Every point drives toward personal conversion and testimony |
| **Help learners find personal relevance** | Rhetorical questions: "Who or what will you allow to take that away?" |

#### Scripture Integration

Elder Brown weaves scripture throughout, not as proof-texts but as part of his argument:

- [D&C 93:38](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng&id=p38#p38) — Children are innocent
- [D&C 6:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) — "What greater witness can you have than from God?"
- [Joseph Smith—History 1:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) — "I knew it, and I knew that God knew it"
- [Alma 32:27-41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p27-p41#p27) — The seed growing (implicit)
- [D&C 121:45](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121?lang=eng&id=p45#p45) — Confidence before God (ties to President Nelson's April 2025 talk!)
- [Matthew 25:14-30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/25?lang=eng&id=p14-p30#p14) — Parable of talents applied to testimony

### 5. INVITE DILIGENT LEARNING

| Manual Principle | How Elder Brown Illustrates It |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Help learners take responsibility** | "Take charge of your testimony" — literally the language of stewardship |
| **Encourage daily study** | Implicit in "work for it... nurture it... feed it truth" |
| **Invite learners to prepare** | His whole talk prepares hearts for a future witness |
| **Encourage learners to share** | Testimony is meant to be "powerful when you share it and use it to testify" |
| **Invite learners to LIVE what they learn** | "I cannot see a better way to use my agency than in defense of my testimony" |

#### The Multi-Layered Invitation

Notice his invitation pattern:

1. **Reflect**: "I invite you to think about your path to a sure witness"
2. **Act**: "Take charge of your testimony; use your agency wisely"
3. **Choose**: "You can choose to believe"
4. **Urgency**: "Get there! Seek it! It is urgent! This is the final dispensation"
5. **Promise**: "I promise that as you do this, your testimony will be a 'well of living water'"

## Masterclass Moment: The John Taylor / Parley P. Pratt Story

> "Before you left Canada, you bore a strong testimony... I now have the same testimony that you then rejoiced in. If the work was true six months ago, it is true today."

**Why this story works so well:**

- Shows someone **teaching someone else** about testimony
- John Taylor didn't just listen—he **took responsibility** for what he'd learned
- He **shared the truth** back to his teacher
- He **lived what he learned** by staying faithful when his mentor faltered

This teaches the principles of the manual through **demonstration**, not just explanation.

## Unique Technique: The List of Functions

> "It will be an *anchor* and a *motivator*, and it will *sustain* you... It will *enable* you... It will *help* you... It will be a *weapon*... Your testimony will be a *joy*... It will be *powerful*..."

This creates emotional momentum through **accumulation**—a technique that mirrors the manual's principle of helping learners see **personal relevance**. Each word answers: "Why does this matter to ME?"

## Key Takeaways

### For My Own Teaching

1. **Specificity invites the Spirit** — Don't generalize sacred experiences; the details carry the witness
2. **Vulnerability creates safety** — Sharing struggle ("It was painful") opens hearts
3. **Connect personal experience to scripture** — "Jamaica is to me like Palmyra was to Joseph Smith"
4. **Use accumulation** — Lists of benefits/functions create emotional momentum
5. **Layer invitations** — Reflect → Act → Choose → Urgency → Promise

### For My Own Testimony

Elder Brown's central message: **Testimony is not temporary.** It's a gift meant to be eternal, multiplied like the talents in the parable. The choice to believe reconnects us with a witness that has never left.

> "Saying 'I choose to believe' makes it easier to receive a witness from God. If we find our testimony weakening, remember that it is the choices we make that diminish the power of the testimony. But the testimony has not gone anywhere. We just need to choose to reconnect with it."

## Personal Reflection

*What is my "Jamaica"? Where is my Sacred Grove?*

*When did the Spirit witness to me with such specificity that I could name the place, time, and moment?*
