# In the Space of Not Many Years — Elder David A. Bednar

**Source:** [In the Space of Not Many Years](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2024/10/35bednar?lang=eng), October 2024 General Conference  
**Speaker:** Elder David A. Bednar, Quorum of the Twelve Apostles  
**Date studied:** February 8, 2026

---

## Overview

This is one of the most important talks of the last decade. Bednar does what the best Book of Mormon teachers do — he takes Benson's charge to read the Book of Mormon as "a book about our future" and shows *exactly* how to do it. No date-setting. No political conspiracy mapping. Just the text, applied with surgical precision to our moment.

The talk has a clean three-part structure:

1. **The Nephites declined** — prosperity → pride → apostasy, "in the space of not many years"
2. **The Lamanites rose** — scriptures → faith → repentance → change of heart → steadfastness
3. **The warning for us** — institutional apostasy won't happen, but *individual* apostasy can and will if we let pride in

The thesis sentence, hiding in the subtitle: *"If we are not faithful and obedient, we can transform the God-given blessing of prosperity into a prideful curse that diverts and distracts us."*

## The Benson Foundation

Bednar doesn't just cite Benson — he *builds on* him. The foundation comes from Benson's October 1986 talk, [The Book of Mormon — Keystone of Our Religion](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion?lang=eng), where President Benson taught:

> "The Book of Mormon … was written for our day. The Nephites never had the book; neither did the Lamanites of ancient times. It was meant for us."

> "If they saw our day, and chose those things which would be of greatest worth to us, is not that how we should study the Book of Mormon? We should constantly ask ourselves, 'Why did the Lord inspire Mormon … to include that in his record? What lesson can I learn from that to help me live in this day and age?'"

Benson also said in that same talk:

> "In the Book of Mormon we find a pattern for preparing for the Second Coming. A major portion of the book centers on the few decades just prior to Christ's coming to America. By careful study of that time period, we can determine why some were destroyed in the terrible judgments that preceded His coming and what brought others to stand at the temple in the land of Bountiful and thrust their hands into the wounds of His hands and feet."

That last paragraph is the seed of everything Bednar does in this talk. He takes the book of Helaman — the *decades before Christ's first coming to the Americas* — and invites us to read it as our mirror. Not allegory. Not code. A *mirror*.

### The Question Benson's Charge Creates

Here's the question Bednar is answering: If Mormon chose what to include because he saw *our day*, then why did he devote so much attention to the Nephite-Lamanite contrast in the book of Helaman? What is it about the half-century before Christ's first coming to the Americas that Mormon (and the Spirit) thought we *especially* needed to understand?

---

## Part 1: The Nephite Decline — "In the Space of Not Many Years"

Bednar draws from Helaman to construct a case study in spiritual collapse. The key scriptures he cites are devastating in their clarity.

### The Speed of the Fall

The phrase that gives the talk its title comes from [Helaman 6:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p32#p32):

> "All these iniquities did come unto them in the space of not many years."

And again in [Helaman 4:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/4?lang=eng&id=p26#p26):

> "Thus had they become weak, because of their transgression, in the space of not many years."

And [Helaman 7:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/7?lang=eng&id=p6#p6):

> "Now this great iniquity had come upon the Nephites, in the space of not many years."

Mormon uses this phrase *three times* across the Helaman narrative. It wasn't gradual decline spanning centuries — it was a generation. Possibly less. A people who knew the gospel, had prophets among them, and had seen miracles collapsed *fast*.

### The Mechanism: Prosperity → Pride → Poison

Bednar identifies the exact mechanism. Here's the sequence from the source texts:

**Step 1: Prosperity and ease.**

> "At the very time when he doth prosper his people, yea, in the increase of their fields, their flocks and their herds, and in gold, and in silver, and in all manner of precious things of every kind and art … yea, and in fine, doing all things for the welfare and happiness of his people; yea, then is the time that they do harden their hearts, and do forget the Lord their God" ([Helaman 12:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/12?lang=eng&id=p2#p2))

**Step 2: Pride enters the church — not from outside, but from within.**

> "Pride … began to enter … into the hearts of the people who professed to belong to the church of God … because of their exceedingly great riches and their prosperity in the land" ([Helaman 3:33, 36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/3?lang=eng&id=p33#p33))

Note Mormon's precision: not "into the church of God" but "into the hearts of the people who *professed* to belong to the church of God." The institution remained. The hearts changed.

**Step 3: Hearts set on riches and vain things.**

> "Ye have set your hearts upon the riches and the vain things of this world, for the which ye do murder, and plunder, and steal, and bear false witness against your neighbor, and do all manner of iniquity" ([Helaman 7:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/7?lang=eng&id=p21#p21))

**Step 4: Boasting in self-sufficiency, rejecting God's rule.**

> "They do not desire that the Lord their God, who hath created them, should rule and reign over them" ([Helaman 12:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/12?lang=eng&id=p6#p6))

> "Because of this their great wickedness, and their boastings in their own strength, they were left in their own strength" ([Helaman 4:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/4?lang=eng&id=p13#p13))

**Step 5: The Spirit withdraws.**

> "The Spirit of the Lord began to withdraw from the Nephites, because of the wickedness and the hardness of their hearts" ([Helaman 6:35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p35#p35))

> "The Spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples" ([Helaman 4:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/4?lang=eng&id=p24#p24))

### What Pride Actually Does

Bednar lists what pride causes, and each item has a Helaman footnote:

| Result of Pride | Source |
|---|---|
| Mock that which is sacred | [Helaman 4:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/4?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) |
| Disbelieve in prophecy and revelation | [Helaman 4:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/4?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) |
| Trample the commandments | [Helaman 6:31](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) |
| Deny the word of God | [Helaman 8:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/8?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) |
| Cast out and mock the prophets | [Helaman 13:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) |
| Revile against the prophets | [Helaman 10:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/10?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) |
| Forget the Lord our God | [Helaman 12:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/12?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) |
| Refuse to let God rule over us | [Helaman 12:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/12?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) |

Every one of these came *after* prosperity. Not during poverty. Not during war. During *ease*.

### Spiritual Blindness and Detours

Bednar then connects pride to spiritual blindness, pulling from Jacob and Lehi's vision:

- **Looking beyond the mark** — [Jacob 4:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4?lang=eng&id=p14#p14): "They despised the words of plainness, and killed the prophets, and sought for things that they could not understand. Wherefore, because of their blindness, which blindness came by looking beyond the mark, they must needs fall." When we pridefully focus on ourselves, we miss Christ as the "mark" entirely.

- **Falling into forbidden paths** — [1 Nephi 8:28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8?lang=eng&id=p28#p28): After tasting the fruit of the tree of life, some "were ashamed, because of those that were scoffing at them; and they fell away into forbidden paths and were lost." They had *tasted* the love of God and still fell. That's the power of pride.

- **Leaning on own understanding** — [Proverbs 3:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/prov/3?lang=eng&id=p5#p5): "Lean not unto thine own understanding."

- **Depending on own wisdom** — [Helaman 16:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/16?lang=eng&id=p15#p15): Right before Christ's birth signs appear, the unbelievers "began to depend upon their own strength and upon their own wisdom." Here is the tragic irony: even as angels appeared and signs were given, they rationalized it all away.

### Samuel's Diagnosis

The climactic voice from the Nephite decline is an outsider — Samuel the Lamanite, standing on a wall. Bednar quotes [Helaman 13:38](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&id=p38#p38):

> "Ye have sought all the days of your lives for that which ye could not obtain; and ye have sought for happiness in doing iniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of that righteousness which is in our great and Eternal Head."

This is Samuel's diagnosis of the core problem: they were looking for happiness in the wrong place. Not that they weren't seeking happiness — they were seeking it relentlessly. But "in doing iniquity," which is *structurally impossible* because it runs "contrary to the nature of that righteousness which is in our great and Eternal Head." You can't get joy from what is fundamentally contrary to joy's source.

## Part 2: The Lamanite Rise — Steadfast in the Faith

Against the Nephite collapse, the Lamanites provide a stunning contrast. They were the ones with *less* history of gospel knowledge. They were the ones who'd been taught incorrect traditions. Yet they rose while the Nephites fell.

### The Lamanite Pathway

From [Helaman 15:7-8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/15?lang=eng&id=p7-p8#p7), Samuel describes the Lamanite transformation:

1. **Holy scriptures** — "Led to believe the holy scriptures"
2. **Prophecies of the prophets** — "All the prophecies of the prophets"
3. **Faith in the Lord** — "Which led them to faith in the Lord"
4. **Repentance** — "And unto repentance"
5. **Change of heart** — "Which faith and repentance bringeth a change of heart"
6. **Firm and steadfast** — "Therefore, as many as have come to this, ye know of yourselves are firm and steadfast in the faith"

The word "steadfast" in Webster 1828 means "firmly fixed or established; not fickle or wavering; constant; firm; resolute; unswerving." This is the exact opposite of the Nephites who were tossed by every wind of prosperity.

### Unwearied Diligence

[Helaman 15:5-6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/15?lang=eng&id=p5-p6#p5):

> "The more part of them are in the path of their duty, and they do walk circumspectly before God, and they do observe to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments. … They are striving with unwearied diligence that they may bring the remainder of their brethren to the knowledge of the truth."

"Circumspectly" (Webster 1828): "cautiously; warily." The Lamanites *watched their step*. They didn't assume they were safe. They walked *carefully*, as people who knew what they could lose.

Contrast this with the Nephites, where Bednar's key observation is devastating: "The more part of the people remained in their pride and wickedness, and the lesser part walked more circumspectly before God" ([Helaman 16:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/16?lang=eng&id=p10#p10)). The "lesser part" walked circumspectly. The *majority* didn't bother.

### The Easiness Paradox

One of the most remarkable phrases in the Book of Mormon appears in [Helaman 6:36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p36#p36):

> "The Lord began to pour out his Spirit upon the Lamanites, because of their easiness and willingness to believe in his words."

"Easiness" in Webster 1828 carries the sense of "freedom from difficulty; compliance; disposition to yield without opposition." The Lamanites had an *easiness to believe*. No pride-hardened resistance. No insistence on understanding everything first. No requirement for signs. Just willingness.

This is exactly what Alma taught in [Alma 32:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p16#p16): "Blessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble." The Lamanites were the living example. The Nephites had to be *compelled* by loss, war, and disaster.

---

## Part 3: The Warning for Us

Here is where Bednar's talk moves from ancient history to direct address.

### Institutional vs. Individual

Bednar makes a critical distinction:

> "Apostasy can occur at two basic levels — institutional and individual. At the institutional level, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will not be lost through apostasy or taken from the earth."

He then quotes Joseph Smith's "Standard of Truth" declaration. The Church will stand. The institution is protected.

*But then:*

> "At the individual level, each of us must 'beware of pride, lest we become as the Nephites of old'" ([D&C 38:39](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38?lang=eng&id=p39#p39)).

This is the pivot of the whole talk. The Nephite problem was never that the Church vanished — it was that the *people inside the Church* let pride corrode their hearts while the institutional forms persisted. Read [Helaman 3:33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/3?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) again: "Pride … began to enter … into the hearts of the people who *professed to belong* to the church of God."

The Church stood. The people fell. That's the type and shadow for us.

### The Birthright Test

Bednar's most arresting modern application:

> "In the space of not many days, weeks, months, or years, we might forfeit our spiritual birthright for far less than a mess of pottage."

He's invoking Esau from [Genesis 25:29-34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/25?lang=eng&id=p29-p34#p29). Esau came in from the field, exhausted and hungry, and sold his birthright — his *inheritance*, his covenant position, his identity — for a bowl of lentil soup. Not for a kingdom. Not for wealth. For *soup*.

"Pottage" (Webster 1828): "a kind of food made by boiling vegetables or meat, or both together, in water; a thick soup." It's the most *ordinary* thing — warm, filling, immediately satisfying, and utterly temporary.

What's our pottage? What temporary satisfactions are we trading eternal covenants for? Bednar doesn't list them. He doesn't need to. If you know, you know.

### The Self-Diagnostic

Then Bednar offers one of the most psychologically precise statements ever made from the pulpit:

> "May I suggest that if you or I believe we are sufficiently strong and stalwart to avoid the arrogance of pride, then perhaps we already are suffering from this deadly spiritual disease. Simply stated, if you or I do not believe we could be afflicted with and by pride, then we are vulnerable and in spiritual danger."

This is the Nephite trap. They didn't think they were in danger. They had the gospel. They had prophets. They had prosperity — which they read as evidence of God's *approval*. And that very confidence was the disease.

The antidote is the opposite posture — the one described in [Mosiah 3:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3?lang=eng&id=p19#p19):

> "The natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father."

### The Final Promise

Bednar closes with a promise rooted in [D&C 19:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19?lang=eng&id=p23#p23):

> "Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me."

And [D&C 23:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/23?lang=eng&id=p1#p1):

> "Beware of pride, lest thou shouldst enter into temptation."

His promise: if we study Helaman asking *why* Mormon included what he did, we'll "discern the applicability of these teachings to the specific conditions of our individual lives and families today." Not general principles — *specific conditions*. He's promising personal revelation through the text.

---

## The Fourth Wall — Written for *Us*

Bednar ends where he began — with Moroni's staggering declaration from [Mormon 8:34-35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/8?lang=eng&id=p34-p35#p34):

> "Behold, the Lord hath shown unto me great and marvelous things concerning that which must shortly come, at that day when these things shall come forth among you. Behold, I speak unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye are not. But behold, Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me, and I know your doing."

Moroni knew us. He saw us. He wrote *to* us. The Book of Mormon is not a historical document we study for information — it's a letter from ancient seers who watched our day in vision and wrote what we'd need.

But what did Moroni see? The very next verse ([Mormon 8:36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/8?lang=eng&id=p36#p36)):

> "I know that ye do walk in the pride of your hearts; and there are none save a few only who do not lift themselves up in the pride of their hearts, unto the wearing of very fine apparel, unto envying, and strifes, and malice, and persecutions, and all manner of iniquities; and your churches, yea, even every one, have become polluted because of the pride of your hearts."

He saw *pride*. Not war. Not famine. Not persecution. He saw a people drowning in prosperity and calling it righteousness.

---

## Personal Reflection: Patterns, Not Predictions

This talk is the antidote to fear-based eschatology. Bednar shows us how to read the Book of Mormon prophetically without ever once setting a date, mapping a political figure, or predicting a catastrophe.

### What Bednar Does Right

1. **Patterns over predictions.** He reads Helaman as a *type* — a repeatable pattern of human behavior — not a coded timeline. The prosperity-pride cycle isn't "this will happen in 2025." It's "this is what happens, always, to people who get comfortable."

2. **Applies it inward first.** The entire second half of the talk is about *us as individuals*. Not governments. Not secret combinations running the world. The question is: "Am I, right now, trading my birthright for pottage?"

3. **Respects the agency of the text.** He lets the scriptures speak. The footnotes are almost entirely from Helaman itself — 26 out of 40 footnotes are from the book of Helaman. He's not importing an interpretive framework. He's reading what's there.

4. **Makes it personal but not political.** He never names a political party, a social movement, or a current event. Every application is about *the heart*. This is how prophets teach.

5. **Ends with a promise, not a threat.** The closing isn't "you'll be destroyed if you don't listen." It's "if you study this, you'll receive personal revelation for your own specific circumstances." Faith over fear.

### The Come Follow Me Connection

Here's something Bednar doesn't say explicitly but the timing makes unmissable: the Church studies the Book of Mormon in Come Follow Me every four years. The last time was 2024 — the *same year* this talk was given. The Book of Mormon comes up in the study cycle during U.S. election years. The CFM 2024 study was reading Helaman right around the time of the election.

Is this by design? The Church doesn't comment on election calendars. But the pattern is striking: every four years, the Saints are immersed in a text that warns about prosperity, pride, secret combinations, corrupted governments, and the importance of choosing righteousness regardless of what the majority does. And then they go vote.

Whether this is providential coincidence or deliberate design, the effect is the same: the Book of Mormon provides a framework for navigating the most politically heated season a nation faces — not by telling you *who* to vote for, but by reminding you *what matters*.

### How This Differs from Fear-Based Reading

Some Book of Mormon teachers (including some I've studied recently) read the Helaman narrative as a *prediction* — "this specific event will happen at this specific time, and this political group is the Gadianton robbers." That approach has problems:

1. It collapses pattern into prediction — and predictions can be wrong.
2. It maps *outward* (them) instead of *inward* (me).
3. It generates fear, not faith. If you're convinced the Gadianton robbers have already "obtained sole management of the government" ([Helaman 6:39](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p39#p39)), what do you do? Panic?

Bednar's approach is the opposite:

1. He reads the pattern as *perennial* — it can happen anytime, to anyone.
2. He maps *inward* — the pride problem is *mine*.
3. He generates hope, not fear. The antidote is available: humility, small and simple things, yielding to the Spirit.

The Lamanites prove it. They were the *less-advantaged* people — less knowledge, less history, less institutional structure. And they outpaced the Nephites because of "their easiness and willingness to believe" ([Helaman 6:36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p36#p36)). We don't need a decoded timeline. We need an easy heart.

## Become

What do I do with this?

1. **Read all of Helaman this month.** Bednar's promise is that personal revelation will come from this study. I'm going to test that promise. All 16 chapters, asking Benson's question at every chapter: "Why did Mormon include this?"

2. **Watch for the prosperity-pride cycle in my own life.** The pattern isn't just national — it's personal. When things are going well, am I more likely to skip scripture study? To pray with less urgency? To assume I've got things figured out? That's [Helaman 12:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/12?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) playing out in a single life.

3. **Cultivate "easiness to believe."** I want the Lamanite virtue, not the Nephite curse. That means approaching prophetic counsel, new callings, and unexpected challenges with *willingness* rather than resistance. Stop requiring an explanation for every commandment. Just yield.

4. **Stop looking for Gadianton robbers out there.** The most potent application of this talk is internal. The question isn't "who are the secret combinations in government today?" — it's "is pride getting a foothold in *my* heart?" If I'm spending more time diagnosing the world's problems than examining my own, I've missed the point.

5. **Remember the birthright.** What am I tempted to trade for pottage? A little recognition at work? One more hour of comfort? Fitting in with the world? Esau's trade looks insane in retrospect, but it made perfect sense to him in the moment. He was tired, he was hungry, and the soup was *right there*. My pottage is whatever is right in front of me when I'm tired and the covenant path feels long.
