# The Atoning Love of Jesus Christ — Study Notes

*Elder Neil L. Andersen, October 2025 General Conference*  
*Elders Quorum Study — February 8, 2026*

---

## Talk Summary

Elder Andersen speaks to two audiences:
1. **Those seeking forgiveness** for serious sins they have committed
2. **Those seeking healing** from wounds caused by the serious sins of others

His central message: **"Healing and forgiveness are each found in their fulness in the atoning love of Jesus Christ."**

## Doctrines (Eternal Truths)

### 1. The Atonement Covers Both Sin and Suffering
> "The powerful compassion of the Savior in forgiving sin and in healing the wounds caused by the sins of others is a most miraculous manifestation of the love of God."

The Atonement isn't just about *our* sins—it's also about what was done *to us*. Christ's sacrifice addresses both:
- Guilt we carry from our own choices
- Pain we carry from others' choices

**Scripture:** [Alma 7:11-12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng&id=p11-p12#p11) — "He will take upon him the pains and sicknesses of his people... that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities."

---

### 2. Forgiveness Comes Through Christ, Not Through Performance
> "Your full forgiveness comes from the Savior. Forgiveness is a divine gift offered through the grace of Jesus Christ."

We confess to bishops; we work to repair what we've broken. But the forgiveness itself is **gift, not wage**. It comes from Christ's grace, not our checklist completion.

**Scripture:** [Enos 1:5-8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1?lang=eng&id=p5-p8#p5) — "Lord, how is it done?" ... "Because of thy faith in Christ."

---

### 3. Christ Knows Our Specific Pain
> "I give you my absolute assurance, the Savior knows you and loves you. Reach out to Him."

This isn't general knowledge—it's *intimate* knowledge. He descended below all things so that nothing we experience is unfamiliar to Him.

---

## Principles (How to Live the Doctrine)

### 1. Divine Approval Comes "By Degrees"
> "They... humbled themselves... in the depths of humility; and... did cry mightily to God.... But the Lord was slow to hear their cry because of their iniquities. Nevertheless the Lord did hear their cries, and began... to ease their burdens... and they began to prosper by degrees." — [Mosiah 21:14-16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/21?lang=eng&id=p14-p16#p14)

**Application:** Don't expect instant relief. The Lord's approval and healing often come gradually—"by degrees." This isn't punishment; it's the natural process of becoming.

*Be patient with yourself. Healing is not instant. Progress is still progress.*

---

### 2. Restitution Goes Beyond Obligation
The man in Elder Andersen's story initially thought his divorce settlement was "generous." But when prompted to fast and pray, he discovered the Lord wanted more—not as punishment, but as part of his own healing.

> "I've learned that restitution isn't just about money. It's about humbly dedicating my life to the Lord."

**Application:** Ask the Lord, "Is there more I can do?" Not from guilt, but from love. Let Him show you what you might not be seeing.

---

### 3. The Lord Will Say "Let These Things Trouble You No More"
> "In the Lord's time, you will feel His voice telling you, 'Let these things trouble you no more.'" — [Alma 42:29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/42?lang=eng&id=p29#p29)

**Application:** There *is* an endpoint. The Lord doesn't intend for you to carry guilt forever. There will come a day when the burden lifts.

---

### 4. Reach Out—He Helps Those Who Ask
President Oaks, quoted in the talk:
> "Our Savior is able to comfort, heal, and strengthen all men and women everywhere, but I believe He does so only for those who seek Him and ask for His help."

**Application:** The blessing isn't automatic—it's responsive to our reaching. Ask. Daily. Specifically.

## Elder Robert E. Wells' Experience

This story is central to the talk. Brother Wells lost his wife in a plane crash and blamed himself for years—feeling responsible for not inspecting the plane better, not training her better.

After a year of dark despair, while praying:
> "I felt as though the Savior came to my side and I heard an audible voice speaking these words to my soul and to my ears: **'Robert, my atoning sacrifice paid for your sins and your mistakes. Your wife forgives you. Your friends forgive you. I will lift your burden.'**"

> "From that moment, the burden of guilt and despair was amazingly lifted from me. I had been rescued! ... I had been given an unearned gift—the Lord's gift of grace. **I didn't deserve it—I had done nothing to merit it, but He gave it to me nonetheless.**"

**Key Insight:** Notice Christ said His atonement paid for *sins AND mistakes*. Brother Wells hadn't sinned—he wasn't negligent or careless. He made judgment calls that turned out tragically. And yet he carried crushing guilt for a year.

*The Atonement covers:*
- Sins (willful disobedience)
- Mistakes (unintentional errors)  
- Regrets (things we wish we'd done differently)
- Wounds (things done to us)

## Seeing Yourself as Christ Sees You

### What Christ Sees:

1. **He sees your potential, not just your past**
   - [Moroni 10:32-33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10?lang=eng&id=p32-p33#p32): "Come unto Christ, and be perfected in him... then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ."

2. **He sees your effort, not just your result**
   - He knows how hard you're trying. He knows your heart. He knows you *want* to be better.

3. **He sees you as worth dying for**
   - He already made His choice. He chose you. The question isn't whether He loves you—that's settled. The question is whether you'll let Him in.

4. **He sees someone who can be "holy, without spot"**
   - Elder Andersen's closing prayer: "May we each be sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of the blood of Christ... becoming holy, without spot."

### What You Might See (That He Doesn't):

- "I should have known better"
- "I can't believe I did that"
- "I don't deserve to feel better"
- "Everyone else has it together"
- "God must be disappointed in me"

**Truth:** These thoughts are not from Him. He is not your accuser—Satan is ([Revelation 12:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/12?lang=eng&id=p10#p10)). Christ is your Advocate ([D&C 45:3-5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45?lang=eng&id=p3-p5#p3)).

## Personal Application: Becoming

*Questions to ponder:*

### For Forgiving Yourself:

1. **What am I still carrying that Christ has already paid for?**
   - A past sin that's been confessed and forsaken?
   - A mistake I made that hurt someone?
   - A season of life I'm ashamed of?

2. **Have I actually asked Christ to lift this specific burden?**
   - Not a vague prayer, but: "Lord, I'm carrying guilt about ___. Please help me feel your forgiveness."

3. **Am I waiting for perfect performance before I accept His grace?**
   - Grace isn't a reward for perfection—it's the power that *makes* us perfect, "by degrees."

4. **What would change if I truly believed He has forgiven me?**

### For Experiencing His Love:

1. **When did I last kneel and pour out my soul to Him?** (Like Enos)
   - Not a rote prayer, but a wrestle—an honest conversation.

2. **What would it look like to "let these things trouble me no more"?**
   - What would I think about instead?
   - How would I feel each morning?
   - How would I treat myself?

3. **Where am I being "slow to hear" my own healing?**
   - Like Limhi's people, sometimes our own iniquities delay our relief. Is there something I'm holding onto that delays my healing?

## Commitments (Application)

*Write personal commitments:*

1. **This week, I will pray specifically about:**
   _______________________________________________

2. **One burden I will consciously give to Christ:**
   _______________________________________________

3. **If I feel guilt return, I will remember:**
   - "His atoning sacrifice paid for your sins and your mistakes."
   - "I didn't deserve it—but He gave it to me nonetheless."

4. **One way I will show grace to myself:**
   _______________________________________________

## Discussion Questions for Elders Quorum

1. Elder Andersen says forgiveness comes "by degrees." How have you experienced gradual healing or gradual peace?

2. Elder Wells carried guilt for something that wasn't really his fault—a tragic accident. Why do we sometimes blame ourselves for things outside our control? How does Christ's Atonement apply to those situations?

3. What's the difference between healthy godly sorrow (that leads to repentance) and unhealthy guilt (that keeps us stuck)?

4. President Oaks said Christ helps "those who seek Him and ask for His help." What does it look like to actively seek His healing, not just passively hope for it?

5. How do we help others who are carrying burdens of guilt or who have been hurt by others' sins?
