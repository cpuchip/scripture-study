# President Russell M. Nelson: Warnings, Invitations, and Promised Blessings (2018–2025)

*Come Follow Me Supplement — Genesis 6–11; Moses 8 — "Noah Found Grace in the Eyes of the Lord"*

> "How is our living prophet like Noah? Of course, the Lord's prophet today isn't warning of a Flood or inviting us to help build an ark. But what is he warning us about? And what is he inviting us to do?" — *Come, Follow Me* Manual

The following is drawn from **44 general conference addresses** by President Nelson from April 2018 (when he became President of the Church) through April 2025. Every quote has been read from the source file.

## I. The Warnings

Noah warned of a flood. President Nelson warns of a spiritual deluge — an overwhelming flood of deception, contention, and distraction that threatens to sweep away faith unless we act.

### The Adversary's Escalating Attacks

From his very first year as prophet, President Nelson sounded an alarm that intensified conference after conference:

> "The adversary is increasing his attacks on faith and upon us and our families at an **exponential rate**." — [Opening Remarks, October 2018](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/10/opening-remarks?lang=eng)

> "The adversary is quadrupling his efforts to disrupt testimonies and impede the work of the Lord." — [We Can Do Better and Be Better, April 2019](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2019/04/36nelson?lang=eng)

> "During these perilous times of which the Apostle Paul prophesied, **Satan is no longer even *trying* to hide his attacks on God's plan.** Emboldened evil abounds." — [Let God Prevail, October 2020](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2020/10/46nelson?lang=eng)

> "We have never needed *positive* spiritual momentum more than we do now, to counteract the speed with which evil and the darker signs of the times are intensifying." — [The Power of Spiritual Momentum, April 2022](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/04/47nelson?lang=eng)

### Spiritual Survival Is at Stake

> "**In coming days, it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost.**" — [Revelation for the Church, Revelation for Our Lives, April 2018](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/04/revelation-for-the-church-revelation-for-our-lives?lang=eng)

This single warning — delivered in his first conference as prophet — may be the defining statement of his ministry. Every subsequent invitation flows from it.

### The Flood of Deception

> "The flood of information available at our fingertips, ironically, makes it increasingly difficult to determine what is true." — [What Is True?, October 2022](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/10/19nelson?lang=eng)

> "We simply cannot rely upon information we bump into on social media. With billions of words online and in a marketing-saturated world constantly infiltrated by noisy, nefarious efforts of the adversary…" — [Hear Him, April 2020](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2020/04/45nelson?lang=eng)

> "If most of the information you get comes from social or other media, your ability to hear the whisperings of the Spirit will be diminished." — [Make Time for the Lord, October 2021](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2021/10/59nelson?lang=eng)

> "Even Saints who are otherwise faithful can be derailed by the steady beat of Babylon's band." — [Make Time for the Lord, October 2021](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2021/10/59nelson?lang=eng)

> "Never take counsel from those who do not believe." — [Think Celestial!, October 2023](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/10/51nelson?lang=eng)

### Contention as Poison

> "Contention violates everything the Savior stood for and taught." — [Preaching the Gospel of Peace, April 2022](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/04/11nelson?lang=eng)

> "**Contention *is* evil!** … Those with 'the spirit of contention' are 'of the devil, who is the father of contention.'" — [Peacemakers Needed, April 2023](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson?lang=eng)

> "The present hostility in public dialogue and on social media is alarming. **Hateful words are deadly weapons.**" — [Confidence in the Presence of God, April 2025](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/57nelson?lang=eng)

### Time Is Running Out

> "**Time is running out.** … Do the spiritual work to find out for yourselves, and please do it now." — ["Come, Follow Me", April 2019](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2019/04/46nelson?lang=eng)

> "I do know that **the Lord is prompting me to urge us to get ready for that 'great and dreadful day.'**" — [Confidence in the Presence of God, April 2025](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/57nelson?lang=eng)

> "Now is the time for you and for me to prepare for the Second Coming of our Lord and Savior, Jesus the Christ." — [The Lord Jesus Christ Will Come Again, October 2024](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2024/10/57nelson?lang=eng)

## II. The Invitations

Noah's invitation was specific: *"Believe and repent of your sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ"* ([Moses 8:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/8?lang=eng&id=p24#p24)). President Nelson's invitations are equally specific and repeated with increasing urgency.

### 1. Hear Him — Seek Personal Revelation Daily

The foundational invitation of his ministry:

> "I urge you to stretch beyond your current spiritual ability to receive personal revelation." — [Revelation for the Church, Revelation for Our Lives, April 2018](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/04/revelation-for-the-church-revelation-for-our-lives?lang=eng)

> "Find a quiet place where you can regularly go. Humble yourself before God. Pour out your heart to your Heavenly Father. Turn to Him for answers and for comfort. Pray in the name of Jesus Christ about your concerns, your fears, your weaknesses—yes, the very longings of your heart. **And then listen!** Write the thoughts that come to your mind." — [Revelation for the Church, April 2018](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/04/revelation-for-the-church-revelation-for-our-lives?lang=eng)

> "As we seek to be disciples of Jesus Christ, **our efforts to *hear Him* need to be ever more intentional.** It takes conscious and consistent effort to fill our daily lives with His words, His teachings, His truths." — [Hear Him, April 2020](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2020/04/45nelson?lang=eng)

> "Daily immersion in the word of God is crucial for spiritual survival, especially in these days of increasing upheaval." — [Hear Him, April 2020](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2020/04/45nelson?lang=eng)

### 2. Repent Daily

> "**I plead with you to repent. Experience the strengthening power of daily repentance—of doing and being a little better each day.**" — [We Can Do Better and Be Better, April 2019](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2019/04/36nelson?lang=eng)

> "Nothing is more liberating, more ennobling, or more crucial to our individual progression than is a regular, daily focus on repentance. Repentance is not an event; it is a process. It is the key to happiness and peace of mind." — [We Can Do Better, April 2019](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2019/04/36nelson?lang=eng)

> "Discover the *joy* of daily repentance." — [The Power of Spiritual Momentum, April 2022](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/04/47nelson?lang=eng)

### 3. Worship in the Temple

Of all his invitations, this one became the crescendo of his ministry:

> "I urge you to find a way to make an appointment regularly with the Lord—to be in His holy house—then keep that appointment with exactness and joy." — [Becoming Exemplary Latter-day Saints, October 2018](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/10/becoming-exemplary-latter-day-saints?lang=eng)

> "I promise that increased time in the temple will bless your life in **ways nothing else can**." — [Focus on the Temple, October 2022](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/10/58nelson?lang=eng)

> "**Nothing will help you *more* to hold fast to the iron rod than worshipping in the temple as regularly as your circumstances permit. Nothing will protect you *more* as you encounter the world's mists of darkness. Nothing will soothe your spirit *more* during times of pain. Nothing will open the heavens *more*. Nothing!**" — [Rejoice in the Gift of Priesthood Keys, April 2024](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2024/04/57nelson?lang=eng)

### 4. Let God Prevail

> "Are you willing to let God prevail in your life? Are you willing to let God be the most important influence in your life? Will you allow His words, His commandments, and His covenants to influence what you do each day? Will you allow His voice to take priority over any other? Are you *willing* to let whatever He needs you to do take precedence over every other ambition? **Are you *willing* to have your will swallowed up in His?**" — [Let God Prevail, October 2020](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2020/10/46nelson?lang=eng)

### 5. Think Celestial

> "When you are confronted with a dilemma, **think celestial!** When tested by temptation, **think celestial!** When life or loved ones let you down, **think celestial!**" — [Think Celestial!, October 2023](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/10/51nelson?lang=eng)

> "Your choices today will determine **three things**: where you will live throughout all eternity, the kind of body with which you will be resurrected, and those with whom you will live forever." — [Think Celestial!, October 2023](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/10/51nelson?lang=eng)

### 6. Be a Peacemaker

> "I urge you to *choose* to be a peacemaker, now and always." — [Peacemakers Needed, April 2023](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson?lang=eng)

> "*Now* is the time to lay aside bitterness. *Now* is the time to cease insisting that it is your way or no way. *Now* is the time to stop doing things that make others walk on eggshells for fear of upsetting you. *Now* is the time to bury your weapons of war." — [Peacemakers Needed, April 2023](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson?lang=eng)

### 7. Increase Your Faith — Choose to Believe

> "If you have doubts about God the Father and His Beloved Son or the validity of the Restoration … *choose* to believe and stay faithful. … **Stop increasing your doubts by rehearsing them with other doubters.**" — [Christ Is Risen; Faith in Him Will Move Mountains, April 2021](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2021/04/49nelson?lang=eng)

> "What would you do if you had *more* faith? Think about it. Write about it. Then *receive more* faith by doing something that *requires more* faith." — [Christ Is Risen, April 2021](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2021/04/49nelson?lang=eng)

### 8. Overcome the World

> "Take charge of your own testimony of Jesus Christ and His gospel. Work for it. Nurture it so that it will grow. Feed it truth. **Don't pollute it with false philosophies of unbelieving men and women.**" — [Overcome the World and Find Rest, October 2022](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/10/47nelson?lang=eng)

> "Cherish and honor your covenants above all other commitments." — [Overcome the World, October 2022](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/10/47nelson?lang=eng)

### 9. Make Christ the Center

> "Now is the time for us to make our discipleship our highest priority." — [The Lord Jesus Christ Will Come Again, October 2024](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2024/10/57nelson?lang=eng)

> "I call upon you to talk of Christ, testify of Christ, have faith in Christ, and rejoice in Christ!" — [The Lord Jesus Christ Will Come Again, October 2024](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2024/10/57nelson?lang=eng)

> "Come unto Christ and 'offer your whole soul' to Him. **This is the secret to a life of joy!**" — [The Lord Jesus Christ Will Come Again, October 2024](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2024/10/57nelson?lang=eng)

## III. The Promised Blessings

Noah promised that those who believed and repented would "receive the Holy Ghost, that ye may have all things made manifest" ([Moses 8:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/8?lang=eng&id=p24#p24)). President Nelson's promises mirror this — and extend it.

### Miracles

### Power of God

## IV. The Arc of His Ministry

Looking across seven years and 44 talks, a clear trajectory emerges:

| Year | Central Message |
|------|----------------|
| **2018** | Prepare — revelation, ministering, temple, correct name |
| **2019** | Repent daily — covenant path, urgency, "time is running out" |
| **2020** | Hear Him — survive spiritually through pandemic and commotion |
| **2021** | Faith takes work — "lazy learners and lax disciples" will not access blessings |
| **2022** | Overcome the world — spiritual momentum, find rest in Christ |
| **2023** | Think celestial, be a peacemaker — contention is evil |
| **2024** | The temple above all else — "nothing will help you more" |
| **2025** | Prepare for His coming — "the Lord is prompting me to urge us to get ready" |

The urgency increases. The specificity sharpens. The promises deepen. The pattern is unmistakable: a prophet, like Noah, calling with increasing intensity to a people who have decreasing time.
