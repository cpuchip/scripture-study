# Noah Found Grace in the Eyes of the Lord

*Come, Follow Me — February 9–15, 2026: [Genesis 6–11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/6?lang=eng); [Moses 8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/8?lang=eng)*

## Lesson Summary

This week covers the Flood, Noah's faithfulness, the covenant of the rainbow, and the Tower of Babel. The manual draws two overarching parallels to our day: (1) Jesus Himself said "as it was in the days of Noah, so it shall be also at the coming of the Son of Man" ([JS—Matthew 1:41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1?lang=eng&id=p41#p41)), and (2) the contrast between Babel (pride → confusion → scattering) and Zion (faith → unity → gathering) is the choice before us now.

## I. "Noah Found Grace" — What Does That Mean?

### The Verse

> "But Noah found **grace** in the eyes of the Lord."
> — [Genesis 6:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/6?lang=eng&id=p8#p8)

The Pearl of Great Price expands this:

> "And thus Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord; for Noah was a **just** man, and **perfect** in his generation; and he **walked with God**, as did also his three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
> — [Moses 8:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/8?lang=eng&id=p27#p27)

### Webster 1828: "Grace"

Noah Webster (1828) defines **grace** as: *"The exercise of love, kindness, mercy, favor; disposition to benefit or serve another."* And in its divine sense: *"The divine favor toward man; the mercy of God, as distinguished from His justice."*

Grace is not earned. It is *favor bestowed*. Noah didn't earn God's favor through achievement — he *found* it by being oriented toward God. He was "just" (righteous), "perfect" (Hebrew: *complete, whole, having integrity*), and he "walked with God."

### Webster 1828: "Perfect"

The Hebrew behind "perfect" in Genesis 6:9 is *tāmîm* — meaning **complete, whole, having integrity**. Webster 1828 captures this: *"Brought to consummation or completeness; not defective; having all properties requisite to its nature and kind."*

Noah wasn't morally flawless — he was *whole*. His heart wasn't divided. In a world where "every imagination of the thoughts of [men's] heart was only evil continually" ([Genesis 6:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/6?lang=eng&id=p5#p5)), Noah's heart was wholly oriented toward God.

### Connection: "Grace to Grace" (Previous Study)

In our [Know God](../know-god.md) study, we explored the concept of "grace to grace" from [D&C 93:12-13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng&id=p12-p13#p12):

> "And I, John, saw that he received not of the fulness at the first, but received grace for grace; And he received not of the fulness at first, but continued from **grace to grace**, until he received a fulness."

Even Christ grew from grace to grace. Noah "found grace" — he entered the same path. That path is available to us: keep the commandments, receive God's favor, grow, receive more. This is the pattern.

**For daily life:** Grace isn't a one-time event. It's a *daily finding*. Am I oriented toward God today — whole, not divided — so that I can continue to *find* grace?

---

## II. The Spirit Will Not Always Strive

### The Warning

> "My Spirit shall not always **strive** with man, for he shall know that all flesh shall die; yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years; and if men do not repent, I will send in the floods upon them."
> — [Moses 8:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/8?lang=eng&id=p17#p17)

The footnote on "strive" points to [2 Nephi 26:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) and [Ether 2:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) — reminders that the Spirit withdraws when consistently rejected.

### Connection: Agency Study

In our [Agency](../agency.md) study, we explored how wickedness can become so pervasive that it destroys the *conditions* for agency:

> Elder Neal A. Maxwell explained that at the time of the Flood, "corruption had reached an agency-destroying point that spirits could not, in justice, be sent here."

This reframes the Flood. It was not an angry God destroying people for being bad — it was a merciful God preserving agency itself. When the moral environment becomes so corrupt that children cannot meaningfully choose God, divine intervention becomes an act of *mercy*, not cruelty.

The same principle applied to Sodom and Gomorrah: when even ten righteous people could not be found ([Genesis 18:23-32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/18?lang=eng&id=p23-p32#p23)), the conditions for moral choice had collapsed.

**For daily life:** I can choose what environment I create — in my home, in my media consumption, in my conversations. Am I creating conditions where the Spirit can strive with me? Or am I pushing it away?

---

## III. Noah Preached the Same Gospel

### The Full Gospel in Noah's Day

Most people think of Noah as "the guy who built a boat." But Moses 8 reveals he was a gospel preacher:

> "Believe and repent of your sins and be **baptized** in the name of **Jesus Christ**, the Son of God, even as our fathers, and ye shall receive the **Holy Ghost**, that ye may have all things made manifest."
> — [Moses 8:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/8?lang=eng&id=p24#p24)

This is stunning. Faith, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost — the same first principles and ordinances — preached by Noah, in the name of Jesus Christ, thousands of years before Christ's mortal ministry.

And the footnote on "manifest" links to [2 Nephi 32:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32?lang=eng&id=p5#p5): the Holy Ghost will "show unto you all things what ye should do." The gospel has always been the same.

**For Sunday School:** This is a great discussion point. How does knowing that Noah preached the *same gospel* we have change how you see the Old Testament? The covenant path isn't a New Testament invention — it's eternal.

## IV. The Ark and the Temple — Walking with God When the World Won't

### Noah "Walked with God"

The phrase "walked with God" ([Genesis 6:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/6?lang=eng&id=p9#p9); [Moses 8:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/8?lang=eng&id=p27#p27)) is the same phrase used for Enoch ([Genesis 5:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/5?lang=eng&id=p24#p24)). The footnote links to the Topical Guide entry [Walking with God](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/tg/walking-with-god?lang=eng).

### Connection: Enoch Study

Last week's lesson was about Enoch. In our [Enoch study](../enoch.md), we explored the invitation "Walk with me" ([Moses 6:34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p34#p34)) — God's personal, intimate invitation. Noah received the same invitation and accepted it.

But where Enoch built **Zion** and his city was taken up, Noah built an **ark**. Both obeyed the same God with the same faith. Enoch's generation had a critical mass of righteous people who could build a holy city. Noah's did not. The difference wasn't in their faithfulness — it was in their circumstances.

> "By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith."
> — [Hebrews 11:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11?lang=eng&id=p7#p7)

Noah acted on a warning about "things not seen as yet." He didn't wait until the rain started. **Faith is acting before the evidence arrives.**

**For daily life:** What is my "ark"? It's not a boat — it's the covenant path. Temple attendance. Scripture study. Prayer. Family home evening. These are the things I build *now*, before the storm, that preserve me and my family when it comes.

## V. The Rainbow — Token of the Covenant

### More Than a Pretty Sky

The standard account says the rainbow is a promise to never flood the earth again ([Genesis 9:12-17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/9?lang=eng&id=p12-p17#p12)). But the JST reveals far more:

> "I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant, which I made unto thy father Enoch; that, **when men should keep all my commandments, Zion should again come on the earth**, the city of Enoch which I have caught up unto myself."
> — [JST Genesis 9:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/jst/jst-gen/9?lang=eng&id=p21#p21)

> "And this is mine everlasting covenant, that **when thy posterity shall embrace the truth, and look upward, then shall Zion look downward, and all the heavens shall shake with gladness, and the earth shall tremble with joy.**"
> — [JST Genesis 9:22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/jst/jst-gen/9?lang=eng&id=p22#p22)

> "And the general assembly of the church of the firstborn shall come down out of heaven, and possess the earth, and shall have place until the end come."
> — [JST Genesis 9:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/jst/jst-gen/9?lang=eng&id=p23#p23)

The rainbow is not just a promise about water. It's a promise about the *return of Zion*. The covenant God made with Enoch was that his city — Zion — would return when the posterity of the righteous "embrace the truth and look upward." This is the covenant we are part of.

### Connection: End Times and Covenants Studies

In our [End Times](../end-times.md) study, we noted that the establishment of Zion/New Jerusalem is among the unfulfilled signs before the Second Coming ([D&C 45:66-67](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45?lang=eng&id=p66-p67#p66)). And in our [Covenants](../covenants.md) study, we explored how the covenant path — the *same* covenant path Noah preached — is the mechanism by which we prepare.

The JST's rainbow promise connects all of it: Enoch's Zion → Noah's covenant → the latter-day gathering → the return of Zion. Every time you see a rainbow, it's a reminder of *that entire chain of promises*.

**For daily life:** Next time I see a rainbow, I want to remember: this isn't just "no more floods." This is God's promise that Zion will return. And I am part of building it.

## VI. Babel vs. Zion — Two Ways to Reach Heaven

### The Wrong Way: Babel

> "Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us **make us a name**, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth."
> — [Genesis 11:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/11?lang=eng&id=p4#p4)

Helaman reveals the spiritual reality behind Babel:

> "And also it is that same being who put it into the hearts of the people to **build a tower sufficiently high that they might get to heaven**. And it was that same being who led on the people who came from that tower into this land; who spread the works of darkness and abominations over all the face of the land, until he dragged the people down to an entire destruction, and to an everlasting hell."
> — [Helaman 6:28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p28#p28)

Satan inspired Babel. The project was about making a name for *themselves*, reaching heaven on *their terms*. The result: confusion (*balal* — Hebrew wordplay on Babel), division, and scattering.

### The Right Way: Zion

Enoch's people tried to reach heaven too — but through righteousness:

> "And the Lord called his people **Zion**, because they were of **one heart and one mind**, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was **no poor** among them."
> — [Moses 7:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7?lang=eng&id=p18#p18)

And what was the result?

> "Zion, in process of time, was **taken up into heaven**."
> — [Moses 7:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7?lang=eng&id=p21#p21)

The contrast is stark:

| | **Babel** | **Zion** |
|---|---|---|
| **Goal** | "Make us a name" | "One heart and one mind" |
| **Method** | Self-reliance, pride | Righteousness, no poor |
| **Inspired by** | Satan ([Helaman 6:28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p28#p28)) | God ([Moses 7:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7?lang=eng&id=p18#p18)) |
| **Result** | Confusion, scattering | Taken up to heaven |

### Connection: Enoch-Charity Study

In our [Faith, Hope, and Charity: The Architecture of Zion](../enoch-charity.md) study, we explored how Zion was built through: faith (the foundation), hope (the sustaining vision), and charity (the binding force). Babel tried to reach heaven through engineering. Zion reached heaven through covenant.

### The Only Way

> "And there is **none other way nor name** given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God."
> — [2 Nephi 31:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31?lang=eng&id=p21#p21)

You can't build a tower tall enough. You can't engineer your way to God. The only way is through Jesus Christ — faith, repentance, baptism, the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. This is the path Noah preached. It is the path that built Zion. It is the path we walk today.

### The Brother of Jared: The Right Response at Babel

While others at Babel tried to reach heaven through pride, Jared and his brother turned to God:

> "Cry unto the Lord, that he will not confound us that we may not understand our words."
> — [Ether 1:34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/1?lang=eng&id=p34#p34)

And the Lord "had compassion... therefore he did not confound the language of Jared" ([Ether 1:35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/1?lang=eng&id=p35#p35)). When everyone around them was confused and scattered, Jared's family was preserved because they cried unto the Lord.

**For daily life:** In a world full of confusion and competing voices — social media noise, political division, cultural upheaval — am I building Babel or Zion? Am I trying to "make a name" for myself, or am I trying to be of one heart with God and my family? When confusion surrounds me, do I cry to the Lord like the brother of Jared?

## VII. "As It Was in the Days of Noah"

### The Lord's Own Comparison

> "But as it was in the days of Noah, so it shall be also at the coming of the Son of Man; For it shall be with them, as it was in the days which were before the flood; for until the day that Noah entered into the ark they were **eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage**; And **knew not** until the flood came, and took them all away."
> — [JS—Matthew 1:41-43](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1?lang=eng&id=p41-p43#p41)

Note what Moses 8 adds — the people's own words:

> "Behold, we are the sons of God; have we not taken unto ourselves the daughters of men? And are we not **eating and drinking, and marrying and giving in marriage**? And our wives bear unto us children, and the same are mighty men, which are like unto men of old, men of great renown."
> — [Moses 8:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/8?lang=eng&id=p21#p21)

They weren't unaware of Noah's message. They *heard him* and dismissed him. Their justification: everything's fine — we're eating, drinking, marrying, having children. Life is normal. Why worry?

The sin isn't eating and drinking. The sin is *normalizing wickedness* and assuming that because life goes on, there is no urgency. "My lord delayeth his coming" ([JS—Matthew 1:51](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1?lang=eng&id=p51#p51)).

### The Antidote

> "Therefore be ye also ready, for in such an hour as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh."
> — [JS—Matthew 1:48](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1?lang=eng&id=p48#p48)

> "And whoso **treasureth up my word**, shall not be deceived."
> — [JS—Matthew 1:37](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1?lang=eng&id=p37#p37)

**For daily life:** The people of Noah's day weren't doing obviously evil things (to themselves). They were just living life without God. Am I treasuring up God's word? Or am I coasting on normalcy and assuming I have time?

---

## Discussion Questions for Sunday School

1. **Moses 8:27** says Noah was "perfect in his generation" — not perfect in the absolute sense, but *complete and whole*. What does it look like to be whole-hearted toward God in our generation?

2. The manual says the Flood was an act of **mercy**. How does Elder Maxwell's insight — that corruption had reached "an agency-destroying point" — change how you see God's justice?

3. The JST reveals the rainbow is a promise about Zion returning ([JST Genesis 9:21-23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/jst/jst-gen/9?lang=eng&id=p21-p23#p21)). How does that change what you think of when you see a rainbow?

4. The people at Babel wanted to "make a name" for themselves and reach heaven by their own means. Where do we see that temptation today? How is Christ's way different?

5. The people in Noah's day heard the prophet and said, "We're fine — we're eating, drinking, and marrying" ([Moses 8:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/8?lang=eng&id=p21#p21)). How do we make sure we're not doing the same thing today?

---

## Scripture to Memorize

> "And thus Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord; for Noah was a just man, and perfect in his generation; and he walked with God, as did also his three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
> — [Moses 8:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/8?lang=eng&id=p27#p27)

**Why this verse:** It captures the entire pattern — grace (God's favor), justice (righteous living), perfection (wholeness of heart), and walking with God (daily communion). It's the formula for safety in corrupt times.

---

## Personal Application: What I Will Do

1. **Find grace daily** — Each morning, orient my heart fully toward God. Not divided. Not distracted. Whole.
2. **Build my ark** — The covenant path is my ark. I will keep attending the temple, studying the scriptures, and doing the daily things that prepare me and my family.
3. **Create Zion conditions** — In my home and conversations, I will foster an environment where the Spirit can strive, not withdraw. One heart, one mind.
4. **Don't normalize complacency** — When I catch myself thinking "things are fine, no urgency," that is the warning sign from Moses 8:21. Treasure up His word daily.
5. **See the rainbow differently** — Next time I see one, remember: this is God's promise that Zion will return, and I am part of that covenant.
