# Come Follow Me Study: "Teach These Things Freely unto Your Children"

**Week:** January 26 – February 1, 2026  
**Reading:** [Genesis 5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/5?lang=eng); [Moses 6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng)  
**Focus:** Blood, Water, and Spirit — Birth, Rebirth, and the Atonement

---

## The Central Teaching: Moses 6:59–60

> "Inasmuch as ye were **born into the world by water, and blood, and the spirit**, which I have made, and so became of dust a living soul, **even so ye must be born again** into the kingdom of heaven, **of water, and of the Spirit, and be cleansed by blood**, even the blood of mine Only Begotten; that ye might be sanctified from all sin..."
> 
> "For **by the water ye keep the commandment**; **by the Spirit ye are justified**, and **by the blood ye are sanctified**."
> — [Moses 6:59–60](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p59-p60#p59)

This is one of the most doctrinally rich passages in all scripture—drawing a direct parallel between physical birth, spiritual rebirth, and our ultimate redemption through Christ.

## The Three Elements: A Comparison

| Element | **Physical Birth** | **Spiritual Rebirth** | **Christ's Atonement** |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Water** | Amniotic fluid—the waters break | Baptism by immersion | Water flowed from His side (John 19:34) |
| **Blood** | Mother's blood sustains life in the womb | Cleansed by Christ's blood | His blood shed in Gethsemane and on the cross |
| **Spirit** | The breath of life—we become a living soul | Gift of the Holy Ghost | He gave up the ghost / Spirit witnesses of Him |

### The Pattern

1. **Water** → *Keeping the commandment* (obedience, covenant)
2. **Spirit** → *Justification* (declared innocent, pardoned)
3. **Blood** → *Sanctification* (made holy, cleansed)

---

## Birth Into Mortality

When we are born physically:
- **Water** — We emerge from the waters of the womb
- **Blood** — Our mother's blood has sustained us; we are "of the flesh"
- **Spirit** — Our spirit enters the body, and we become "a living soul" ([Moses 6:59](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p59#p59))

This mirrors the creation of Adam:
> "I, the Lord God, formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul"  
> — [Moses 3:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/3?lang=eng&id=p7#p7)

---

## Rebirth Through Baptism

Just as we were born into this fallen world by water, blood, and spirit, we must be **born again** into the kingdom of heaven by the same elements:

| Physical Birth | Spiritual Rebirth |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Water of the womb | Water of baptism |
| Mother's blood | Christ's atoning blood |
| Spirit enters body | Holy Ghost received |

### Adam's Baptism: Moses 6:64–66

> "Adam cried unto the Lord, and he was caught away by the Spirit of the Lord, and was carried down into the water, and was laid under the water, and was brought forth out of the water.
> 
> And thus he was baptized, and the Spirit of God descended upon him, and thus he was **born of the Spirit**, and became **quickened in the inner man**.
> 
> And he heard a voice out of heaven, saying: Thou art **baptized with fire, and with the Holy Ghost**."

After this experience, Adam heard: "Thou art one in me, **a son of God**; and thus may all become my sons." ([Moses 6:68](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p68#p68))

## Christ's Death: The Same Three Witnesses

When Christ died on the cross, the same three elements testified:

> "One of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out **blood and water**."  
> — [John 19:34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/19?lang=eng&id=p34#p34)

> "Father, into thy hands I commend my **spirit**: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost."  
> — [Luke 23:46](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/23?lang=eng&id=p46#p46)

### 1 John 5:6–8 — The Three Witnesses

> "This is he that came by **water and blood**, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the **Spirit** that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.
> 
> For there are **three that bear record** in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.
> 
> And there are **three that bear witness** in earth, the **spirit, and the water, and the blood**: and these three agree in one."

## The Role of Each Element

### Water — Covenant & Obedience
> "By the water ye keep the commandment" ([Moses 6:60](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p60#p60))

- Baptism is the *gate* ([2 Nephi 31:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31?lang=eng&id=p17#p17))
- We witness our willingness to take upon us Christ's name
- We covenant to keep His commandments
- This is our *action* — our part of the covenant

### Spirit — Justification
> "By the Spirit ye are justified" ([Moses 6:60](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p60#p60))

- **Justified** = declared innocent, pardoned before the law
- The Holy Ghost witnesses that we are forgiven
- The Spirit "quickens" us — makes us spiritually alive
- This is the *witness* that our offering is accepted

### Blood — Sanctification
> "By the blood ye are sanctified" ([Moses 6:60](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p60#p60))

- **Sanctified** = made holy, cleansed, set apart
- Only Christ's blood can purify us from sin
- This is the *power* that actually transforms us
- "The blood of Christ... sanctifieth from all sin" ([Moses 6:59](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p59#p59))

Elder D. Todd Christofferson explained:
> "The Savior offers to all who will have faith and accept it, the gifts of being justified or pardoned before the law and also being sanctified—that is, being made spotless and holy. There is no other name, nor way, nor means whereby such redemption may occur."
> — [Born Again](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2008/04/born-again?lang=eng), April 2008

## Leaving Mortality: The Pattern Continues?

**Question to ponder:** If water, blood, and spirit mark our *entrance* into mortality and our *rebirth* through baptism, do they also mark our *exit* from mortality and entry into immortality?

Consider:
- At death, the **spirit** leaves the body
- In resurrection, the **blood** is replaced by spirit (quickened, immortal body)
- The earth will be **baptized by fire** as part of celestialization

The pattern of three witnesses continues throughout the plan of salvation.

---

## Connection to Moses 6:63

> "All things have their likeness, and **all things are created and made to bear record of me**, both things which are temporal, and things which are spiritual; things which are in the heavens above, and things which are on the earth... all things bear record of me."

The very elements of our physical birth testify of Christ and our need for spiritual rebirth through Him. This is by design—"all things bear record of me."

## Questions for Further Study

1. How does understanding the water/blood/spirit pattern deepen my appreciation for the sacrament? (Water → blood, witnessing → Spirit)

2. What does it mean to be "quickened in the inner man"? ([Moses 6:65](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p65#p65))

3. How does the temple continue this pattern of birth, rebirth, and entering God's presence?

4. Why did John emphasize that Jesus came "not by water only, but by water and blood"? ([1 John 5:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-jn/5?lang=eng&id=p6#p6))

5. How does the phrase "Man of Holiness" (the Father's name in Adam's language) and "Son of Man" illuminate the relationship between Father and Son? ([Moses 6:57](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p57#p57))
