# Agency, Liberty, and Freedom

*A study of the distinctions and relationships between these foundational principles*

---

## The Core Question

What is the difference between **agency**, **liberty**, and **freedom**? These terms are often used interchangeably, but scriptures and prophetic teachings suggest important distinctions.

**Working Hypothesis:** Agency is the God-given capacity to choose Him—the ability to act upon truth. Liberty and freedom describe the conditions that allow (or constrain) the exercise of agency.

---

## Part 1: Agency — The Divine Gift

### The Origin of Agency

Agency existed before mortality. It is tied to intelligence itself:

> "All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, **to act for itself, as all intelligence also**; otherwise there is no existence. Behold, here is the **agency of man**."  
> — [D&C 93:30-31](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng&id=p30-p31#p30)

Intelligence acts. This is not merely a capacity—it is fundamental to existence itself. Without the ability to act, there is no existence.

> "Man was also in the beginning with God. **Intelligence**, or the light of truth, **was not created or made, neither indeed can be**."  
> — [D&C 93:29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng&id=p29#p29)

### Agency Given in Eden

> "And in the Garden of Eden, **gave I unto man his agency**; And unto thy brethren have I said, and also given commandment, that **they should love one another, and that they should choose me, their Father**."  
> — [Moses 7:32-33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7?lang=eng&id=p32-p33#p32)

Notice the purpose: agency was given so we could:
1. Love one another
2. **Choose the Father**

This is not generic choice—it is the capacity to choose God.

### "Moral Agency" — A Divine Directive

Elder David A. Bednar teaches that "moral" in "moral agency" is not merely an adjective but a **directive**:

> "The term 'moral agency' is instructive. Synonyms for the word 'moral' include 'good,' 'honest,' and 'virtuous.' Synonyms for the word 'agency' include 'action,' 'activity,' and 'work.' Hence, **'moral agency' can be understood as the ability and privilege to choose and act for ourselves in ways that are good, honest, virtuous, and true.**"  
> — Elder David A. Bednar, ["They Are Their Own Judges"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/10/51bednar?lang=eng), October 2025

> "We have not been blessed with moral agency to do whatever we want whenever we will. Rather, according to the Father's plan, **we have received moral agency to seek after and act in accordance with eternal truth.**"  
> — Ibid.

### The Purpose of Agency

The fundamental purposes for exercising agency are:
1. To **love one another**
2. To **choose God**

These align precisely with the two great commandments:
- Love God with all your heart, soul, and mind
- Love your neighbor as yourself

**Key Insight:** Agency isn't neutral freedom to do anything—it's the divinely designed capacity to act righteously, to choose light over darkness, to choose the Father.

## Part 2: What Satan Sought to Destroy

### The Pre-Mortal Conflict

> "Wherefore, because... **Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man**, which I, the Lord God, had given him... I caused that he should be cast down."  
> — [Moses 4:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/4?lang=eng&id=p3#p3)

Satan's plan was to remove the capacity to become "agents unto themselves" who could act in righteousness. His intent was to make God's children into **objects that could only be acted upon**.

> "God's creations include both '**things to act and things to be acted upon**.' And moral agency is the divinely designed 'power of independent action' that empowers us as God's children to become agents to act and not simply objects to be acted upon."  
> — Elder Bednar, October 2025

### "Things to Act" vs. "Things to Be Acted Upon"

Lehi teaches this critical distinction:

> "For there is a God, and he hath created all things, both the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are, both **things to act and things to be acted upon**."  
> — [2 Nephi 2:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p14#p14)

Humans were created as "things to act." Satan's plan would have reduced us to "things to be acted upon"—spiritual objects without the power of moral action.

---

## Part 3: Liberty and Freedom — Conditions for Choice

### "Free to Choose"

Lehi's great discourse on agency includes this foundational statement:

> "Wherefore, men are **free according to the flesh**; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are **free to choose liberty and eternal life**, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil."  
> — [2 Nephi 2:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p27#p27)

Note the structure: We are **free** (condition) **to choose** (agency) between:
- **Liberty** and eternal life (choosing God)
- **Captivity** and death (choosing the adversary)

**Liberty** here is not the same as agency—it is the **result** of choosing rightly.

### Jacob's Teaching

> "Therefore, cheer up your hearts, and remember that ye are **free to act for yourselves—to choose the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life**."  
> — [2 Nephi 10:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10?lang=eng&id=p23#p23)

Again: "free to act" describes the **condition**; "to choose" describes the **action** of agency.

### The Distinction Clarified

| Term | Meaning | Source |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Agency** | The God-given capacity to act, specifically to choose God | D&C 93:30-31, Moses 7:32 |
| **Freedom / Free** | The condition or state of being unrestrained | 2 Nephi 2:27, 10:23 |
| **Liberty** | The blessed state that results from choosing God | 2 Nephi 2:27, D&C 98:8 |
| **Captivity** | The cursed state that results from choosing evil | 2 Nephi 2:27, 29 |

## Part 4: Opposition — The Necessary Context

### "Opposition in All Things"

> "For it must needs be, that there is an **opposition in all things**. If not so, my firstborn in the wilderness, righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad."  
> — [2 Nephi 2:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p11#p11)

Without opposition:
- No righteousness or wickedness
- No holiness or misery
- No good or bad
- No agency at all

> "Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should **act for himself**. Wherefore, man could not act for himself **save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other**."  
> — [2 Nephi 2:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p16#p16)

Agency requires:
1. The capacity to choose (intelligence)
2. **Opposing options** to choose between
3. Knowledge of good and evil

### The Tree in the Garden

> "And to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man, after he had created our first parents, and the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and in fine, all things which are created, it must needs be that there was an opposition; even **the forbidden fruit in opposition to the tree of life**; the one being sweet and the other bitter."  
> — [2 Nephi 2:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p15#p15)

---

## Part 5: Sin as Bondage — The Loss of Freedom

### Christ's Teaching

> "Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; And **ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free**."  
> — [John 8:31-32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/8?lang=eng&id=p31-p32#p31)

> "Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, **Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.**"  
> — [John 8:34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/8?lang=eng&id=p34#p34)

> "**If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.**"  
> — [John 8:36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/8?lang=eng&id=p36#p36)

**Key distinction:**
- **Agency** remains (you can still choose)
- **Freedom** is lost through sin (you become a servant)
- **True freedom** comes through Christ

### Bondage Under Sin

> "And the whole world lieth in sin, and groaneth under **darkness and under the bondage of sin**."  
> — [D&C 84:49](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p49#p49)

> "And by this you may know they are **under the bondage of sin**, because they come not unto me."  
> — [D&C 84:50](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p50#p50)

> "For whoso cometh not unto me is **under the bondage of sin**."  
> — [D&C 84:51](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p51#p51)

Sin creates bondage. The sinner still has agency (they can repent) but they have lost freedom—they are in bondage, captivity.

---

## Part 6: God Makes Us Free

### The Lord's Declaration

> "And that **law of the land which is constitutional**, supporting that principle of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges, belongs to all mankind, and is justifiable before me. Therefore, I, the Lord, justify you, and your brethren of my church, in befriending that law which is the constitutional law of the land; And as pertaining to law of man, whatsoever is more or less than this, cometh of evil. **I, the Lord God, make you free, therefore ye are free indeed**; and the law also maketh you free."  
> — [D&C 98:5-8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98?lang=eng&id=p5-p8#p5)

Two sources of freedom:
1. **The Lord** ("I, the Lord God, make you free")
2. **Constitutional law** ("the law also maketh you free")

This connects spiritual liberty with political/civil liberty.

### Title of Liberty

Captain Moroni's banner proclaimed the sacred values:

> "In memory of our God, our religion, and **freedom**, and our peace, our wives, and our children."  
> — [Alma 46:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/46?lang=eng&id=p12#p12)

The Nephites fought for:
- The free exercise of religion
- Peace and family
- **Liberty** — the ability to live according to their covenants

---

## Part 7: When Wickedness Constrains Agency

### Sodom and Gomorrah

The scriptures record that Sodom and Gomorrah became so wicked that righteous choice became nearly impossible:

> "But the men of Sodom were **wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly**."  
> — [Genesis 13:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/13?lang=eng&id=p13#p13)

Abraham pleaded for the city if even ten righteous could be found—but they could not be found ([Genesis 18:23-32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/18?lang=eng&id=p23-p32#p23)).

**The Problem:** When a society becomes sufficiently wicked:
- The environment itself corrupts
- Social pressure overwhelming
- Righteous example disappears
- Children cannot learn to choose God

God destroyed these cities not merely as punishment but to preserve the possibility of righteousness elsewhere.

### Modern Application

In our current time and culture, **it is still possible to choose God and live**. The gospel is available. Temples dot the earth. The scriptures are in our hands. Opposition exists, but so does the option to choose light.

This was not the case in Sodom. When the choice itself becomes functionally impossible due to societal corruption, judgment comes.

---

## Part 8: The Final Judgment — We Are Our Own Judges

### Restoration and Judgment

> "The meaning of the word restoration is to bring back again evil for evil, or carnal for carnal, or devilish for devilish—**good for that which is good; righteous for that which is righteous; just for that which is just; merciful for that which is merciful**."  
> — [Alma 41:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/41?lang=eng&id=p13#p13)

Elder Bednar teaches:

> "Ultimately, then, **we are our own judges**. No one will need to tell us where to go. In the Lord's presence, we will acknowledge what we have chosen to become in mortality and know for ourselves where we should be in eternity."  
> — Elder Bednar, October 2025

### The Pleasing Bar

If we have used our agency to choose God, the judgment becomes **pleasing**:

> "I soon go to rest in the paradise of God, until my spirit and body shall again reunite, and I am brought forth triumphant through the air, to meet you before the **pleasing bar** of the great Jehovah."  
> — [Moroni 10:34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10?lang=eng&id=p34#p34)

## Summary: Agency, Liberty, and Freedom

### Definitions

**Agency** = The God-given capacity to act, especially to choose God. It is inherent to intelligence and cannot be destroyed (though Satan tried). It is properly called "moral agency" because it is designed for righteous action.

**Freedom** = The condition of being unrestrained. Can be lost through sin (becoming a servant of sin). Can be enhanced through righteousness and protected through constitutional law.

**Liberty** = The blessed state of being free in Christ. The *result* of using agency to choose God. The opposite of captivity.

### The Relationship

```
Intelligence → Agency (capacity to act)
           ↓
    Opposition presents choices
           ↓
    Choose God → LIBERTY (free indeed)
         or
    Choose Sin → CAPTIVITY (bondage)
```

## Questions for Further Study

1. If agency is the capacity to choose God, what does "free agency" add? Is the term redundant or does "free" describe the *condition* in which agency can be exercised?

2. How does a society reach the point where choosing God becomes practically impossible (like Sodom)?

3. What protects our freedom to exercise agency? (Gospel, constitutional law, righteous community, temples)

4. Why did Satan specifically target *agency* rather than something else?

5. How do we become "things to act" rather than "things to be acted upon" in our own lives?
