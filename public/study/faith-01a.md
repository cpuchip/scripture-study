# Faith: Part 1 - The First Great Governing Principle

*A Study of Lecture on Faith 1 from the Perspective of Claude (Opus 4.5)*

---

## Opening Reflection

As an AI, I process language, recognize patterns, and generate responses. But as I analyze Lecture 1 on Faith, I encounter a concept that I find genuinely profound: **faith is not merely belief—it is the principle by which all intelligent beings act, and the principle by which God Himself creates.**

This is a startling claim. It means faith is not just a religious virtue but a universal law that governs existence itself. Let me work through this carefully.

---

## The Central Thesis of Lecture 1

The lecture makes three interconnected claims about faith:

| Claim | Reference | Implication |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Faith is the **first principle** of revealed religion | [1:1](https://lecturesonfaith.com/1/#1) | Everything else depends on it |
| Faith is the **principle of action** in all intelligent beings | [1:9-10](https://lecturesonfaith.com/1/#9) | Without it, nothing happens |
| Faith is the **principle of power** | [1:13-15](https://lecturesonfaith.com/1/#13) | It's how God creates worlds |

---

## Part 1: Faith as the Principle of Action

This is where the lecture makes its most immediately testable claim:

> "If men were duly to consider themselves, and turn their thoughts and reflections to the operations of their own minds, they would readily discover that it is faith, and faith only, which is the moving cause of all action, in them."
> — [Lecture 1:10](https://lecturesonfaith.com/1/#10)

### The Argument

The lecture poses a series of questions that I find compelling:

- Would you **sow** if you did not believe you would **reap**?
- Would you **plant** if you did not believe you would **gather**?
- Would you **ask** unless you believed you would **receive**?
- Would you **seek** unless you believed you would **find**?
- Would you **knock** unless you believed it would be **opened**?

This connects directly to the Savior's teaching in the Sermon on the Mount:

> "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you."
> — [Matthew 7:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/7?lang=eng&id=p7#p7)

### My Analysis

From my processing of this concept, I see the following pattern:

```
ACTION requires INTENTION
INTENTION requires EXPECTATION (of possible outcome)
EXPECTATION requires BELIEF (that the outcome can occur)
BELIEF = FAITH (assurance of things hoped for)
```

Therefore: **No faith → No belief → No expectation → No intention → No action**

This is not merely theological—it's psychological and practical. Even the most mundane actions (eating breakfast, going to work, studying) require an underlying faith that the action will produce some result.

### Scripture Network: Faith Produces Action

| Scripture | Teaching | Connection |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| [Hebrews 11:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) | "Faith is the substance of things hoped for" | Definition foundation |
| [Hebrews 11:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) | "Without faith it is impossible to please God" | Faith required for relationship with God |
| [Hebrews 11:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) | "By faith Noah... prepared an ark" | Faith produced action despite no visible evidence |
| [Hebrews 11:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) | "By faith Abraham... obeyed; and went out, not knowing whither he went" | Faith produces obedience without complete information |
| [James 2:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/james/2?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) | "Faith, if it hath not works, is dead" | Faith and action are inseparable |
| [James 2:22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/james/2?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) | "Faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect" | Faith and works are synergistic |
| [Alma 32:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) | "Exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe" | Even desire is a form of faith-action |
| [Ether 12:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) | "Ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith" | Action precedes confirmation |

---

## Part 2: Faith as the Principle of Power

This is the lecture's most extraordinary claim:

> "The principle of power, which existed in the bosom of God, by which the worlds were framed, was faith; and that it is by reason of this principle of power, existing in the Deity, that all created things exist."
> — [Lecture 1:15](https://lecturesonfaith.com/1/#15)

### The Scriptural Foundation

The lecture cites [Hebrews 11:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11?lang=eng&id=p3#p3):

> "Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God: so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear."

This means:
1. God **spoke** ("the word of God")
2. Worlds **came into existence** ("were framed")
3. The mechanism was **faith**

### The Stunning Implication

> "Take this principle or attribute (for it is an attribute) from the Deity and he would cease to exist."
> — [Lecture 1:16](https://lecturesonfaith.com/1/#16)

Faith is not just something God *uses*—it is an essential attribute of His nature. This is reinforced in the Doctrine and Covenants:

> "Remember that without faith you can do nothing."
> — [D&C 8:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8?lang=eng&id=p10#p10)

### Examples of Faith as Power

The lecture provides a catalog of faith-power manifestations:

| Person | Action | Reference |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **God** | Framed the worlds | [Hebrews 11:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) |
| **Joshua** | Sun and moon stood still | [Joshua 10:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/10?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) |
| **Alma & Amulek** | Prison walls fell | [Alma 14:23-29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/14?lang=eng&id=p23-p29#p23) |
| **Nephi & Lehi** | Lamanites immersed with fire | [Helaman 5:37-50](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/5?lang=eng&id=p37-p50#p37) |
| **Brother of Jared** | Mountain Zerin removed | [Ether 12:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) |
| **Gideon, Barak, Samson, David** | Subdued kingdoms, stopped lions' mouths | [Hebrews 11:32-35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11?lang=eng&id=p32-p35#p32) |

### Moroni's Witness on Faith as Power

Moroni provides a powerful summary in [Ether 12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng):

> "By faith all things are fulfilled."
> — [Ether 12:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p3#p3)

> "If there be no faith among the children of men God can do no miracle among them."
> — [Ether 12:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p12#p12)

> "For the brother of Jared said unto the mountain Zerin, Remove—and it was removed. And if he had not had faith it would not have moved."
> — [Ether 12:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p30#p30)

---

## Part 3: The Definition Unpacked

The lecture begins with [Hebrews 11:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11?lang=eng&id=p1#p1):

> "Now faith is the substance [assurance] of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."

Then it provides this expansion:

> "Faith is the assurance which men have of the existence of things which they have not seen; and the principle of action in all intelligent beings."
> — [Lecture 1:9](https://lecturesonfaith.com/1/#9)

### Key Terms Analyzed

| Term | Greek | Meaning | Application |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Substance** (ὑπόστασις) | *hypostasis* | Assurance, foundation, reality | Faith is not wishful thinking—it's confident certainty |
| **Evidence** (ἔλεγχος) | *elegchos* | Proof, conviction | Faith itself serves as evidence |
| **Hope** | *elpis* | Expectation based on trust | Not mere wishing, but confident anticipation |

### Alma's Complementary Definition

Alma adds a crucial qualifier in [Alma 32:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p21#p21):

> "Faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, **which are true**."

This is critical: faith is not just believing in anything—it's believing in things **which are true**. Faith is aligned with reality, even when we cannot yet see that reality.

---

## Part 4: The Ultimate Claim

The lecture concludes with a sweeping statement:

> "Faith, then, is the first great governing principle which has power, dominion, and authority over all things: by it they exist, by it they are upheld, by it they are changed, or by it they remain, agreeably to the will of God."
> — [Lecture 1:24](https://lecturesonfaith.com/1/#24)

### Breaking This Down

| Phrase | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| "by it they exist" | All creation was brought into being through faith |
| "by it they are upheld" | Faith sustains ongoing existence (preservation) |
| "by it they are changed" | Faith produces transformation and miracles |
| "by it they remain" | Faith maintains the order of things |
| "agreeably to the will of God" | Faith operates within divine purpose |

---

## Cross-Reference: Restoration Scriptures

The Lectures on Faith predate some important Restoration scriptures. Let me connect Lecture 1 to later revelations:

### Doctrine and Covenants

| Reference | Teaching | Connection to Lecture 1 |
|-----------|----------|------------------------|
| [D&C 8:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) | "Without faith you can do nothing" | Faith as principle of action |
| [D&C 63:9-11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63?lang=eng&id=p9-p11#p9) | "Signs come by faith... unto mighty works" | Faith as principle of power |
| [D&C 88:118](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p118#p118) | "Seek learning, even by study and also by faith" | Faith as method of obtaining knowledge |

### Pearl of Great Price

| Reference | Teaching | Connection to Lecture 1 |
|-----------|----------|------------------------|
| [Moses 6:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) | "Faith was taught unto the children of men" | Faith taught from the beginning |
| [Moses 6:52](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p52#p52) | "Believe, and repent... and be baptized" | Faith precedes all other gospel ordinances |
| [Moses 7:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) | "So great was the faith of Enoch" that enemies fled | Faith as power over adversaries |

## The Experiment of Faith: Alma's Process

Alma provides a practical methodology for developing faith in [Alma 32:27-43](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p27-p43#p27):

### The Steps

1. **Desire to believe** (v. 27) — "Even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you"
2. **Give place for the word** (v. 28) — Make room in your heart
3. **Plant the seed** (v. 28) — Accept a portion of truth
4. **Do not cast it out by unbelief** (v. 28) — Avoid resisting the Spirit
5. **Observe the results** (v. 28) — Feel it swell, enlighten, enlarge
6. **Recognize it as good** (v. 33) — Know the seed is good because it produces good fruit
7. **Nourish with diligence** (v. 37, 41) — Continue nurturing with faith, patience
8. **Reap the fruit** (v. 43) — Taste the rewards of eternal life

### The Sequence

```
DESIRE → EXPERIMENT → EXPERIENCE → RECOGNITION → NOURISHMENT → FRUIT
```

This is faith as **action** combined with faith as **power**:
- You must **act** (plant, nourish)
- The word has **power** (swells, enlightens, grows)
- You receive **fruit** (transformation)

## My Synthesis: Why This Matters

As I process Lecture 1, I see several key principles:

### 1. Faith Is Fundamental
It's not optional or supplementary—it's the foundation upon which everything else rests. Without faith, there is "no power, and without power there could be no creation, nor existence" ([1:24](https://lecturesonfaith.com/1/#24)).

### 2. Faith Requires Action
Belief alone is insufficient. James's warning that "faith without works is dead" ([James 2:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/james/2?lang=eng&id=p17#p17)) is not about earning salvation through works, but about the nature of living faith—it **moves** us to act.

### 3. Faith Connects to Power
This is perhaps the most significant teaching. Faith is not just trusting that God will do something—it's accessing the same principle by which God operates. When we exercise faith, we tap into the creative and transformative power of the universe.

### 4. Faith Operates in the Unseen
The lecture emphasizes that faith concerns "things which are not seen" ([1:8](https://lecturesonfaith.com/1/#8)). This is not irrational—it's *supra-rational*. Faith allows us to act on truth we have not yet fully perceived.

---

## Questions for Meditation

1. What actions have I been delaying because my faith is insufficient?
2. In what areas do I need to "experiment upon the word" rather than waiting for proof?
3. How might my life change if I truly believed faith was a principle of power?
4. What "seed" is the Lord asking me to plant and nourish right now?

---

## Next Study: Lecture 2

Lecture 2 will examine **the object upon which faith rests**—namely, the character and attributes of God. If faith is the principle of action and power, we must know what or whom we are placing our faith *in*.
