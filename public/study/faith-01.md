## Core Claim: Faith Is a Principle of Action

Lecture 1 insists that faith is not passive belief. It is the *moving cause* of action in both temporal and spiritual life. This matches your working thesis: **faith is belief + action**.

**Lecture 1 anchors**
- Faith as assurance and evidence: [Hebrews 11:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11?lang=eng&id=p1#p1)
- Faith as action: [Hebrews 11:7–9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11?lang=eng&id=p7-p9#p7)
- Faith in spiritual action (belief + baptism): [Mark 16:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/16?lang=eng&id=p16#p16)

**New Testament confirmation (faith → works)**
- “Faith without works is dead” ([James 2:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/james/2?lang=eng&id=p17#p17))
- “Show me thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my works” ([James 2:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/james/2?lang=eng&id=p18#p18))

**Book of Mormon confirmation**
- “If ye have faith ye can do all things which are expedient unto me” ([Moroni 10:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10?lang=eng&id=p23#p23))
- “If a man have faith he must needs have hope” ([Moroni 10:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10?lang=eng&id=p20#p20))

## Core Claim: Faith Is a Principle of Power

Lecture 1 teaches that faith is the principle by which God framed worlds and by which He exercises power. It is *the* governing principle in heaven and on earth.

**Scriptural anchors in the lecture**
- “Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God” ([Hebrews 11:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11?lang=eng&id=p3#p3))
- Mustard-seed faith moves mountains ([Matthew 17:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/17?lang=eng&id=p20#p20))

**Book of Mormon examples (faith as power)**
- Alma and Amulek delivered ([Alma 14:26–29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/14?lang=eng&id=p26-p29#p26))
- Nephi and Lehi in prison ([Helaman 5:44–50](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/5?lang=eng&id=p44-p50#p44))
- Brother of Jared: Zerin moved ([Ether 12:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p30#p30))

## Key Observations

1. **Faith is more than belief**: It moves us to act before outcomes are seen.
2. **Faith is power**: It changes what is possible when aligned with God’s will.
3. **Faith grows by use**: It increases as we *exercise* it.
4. **Faith anchors hope**: Faith and hope are inseparable in scripture.

---

## Questions for Meditation

1. Where in my life am I *believing* but not yet *acting*?
2. What would it look like to act “as if” God’s promise is true, before I see it?
3. How does faith become power in real, daily decisions (not just dramatic miracles)?
4. Which scriptural account of faith-as-action mirrors my current situation?

## Next Step (Lecture 2)

Lecture 2 will focus on the **object** on which faith rests. Before moving on, review Lecture 1 and identify:
- Faith’s definition in your own words
- One action step you will take this week as an experiment in faith
