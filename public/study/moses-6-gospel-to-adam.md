# Moses 6: The Gospel Taught From the Beginning

*Come Follow Me: January 26–February 1, 2026*  
*"Teach These Things Freely unto Your Children"*

---

## Overview

Moses 6 is one of the most doctrinally rich chapters in all of scripture. Through Joseph Smith's inspired translation, we learn what Genesis barely hints at: that the fulness of the gospel—faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost—was taught to Adam and passed down through the patriarchs.

This chapter directly connects to our ongoing studies:
- **Faith:** [faith-01a.md](faith-01a.md) — Lecture 1 claims "faith was taught unto the children of men" from the beginning. Moses 6:23 confirms it.
- **Intelligence:** [intelligence-01.md](intelligence-01.md) — The light, truth, and intelligence themes from D&C 93 find their practical application here in the Comforter's description (v. 61).

---

## Part 1: Faith Taught From the Beginning

### The Lecture 1 Connection

Lecture on Faith 1:13 makes this bold claim:

> "We here observe that God is the object of faith… and this was taught from the beginning."
> — [Lecture 1:13](https://lecturesonfaith.com/1/#13)

Moses 6:23 confirms it:

> "And they were preachers of righteousness, and spake and prophesied, and called upon all men, everywhere, to repent; and **faith was taught unto the children of men.**"
> — [Moses 6:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p23#p23)

### The Pattern of Faithful Fathers

| Patriarch | What They Did | Reference |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| Adam | Called upon sons to repent | [6:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng) |
| Seth | Offered acceptable sacrifice, did not rebel | [6:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng) |
| Enos | Prophesied all his days | [6:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng) |
| Jared | Taught Enoch in all the ways of God | [6:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng) |

This chain of faithful teaching demonstrates the Lecture 1 principle: faith is passed through testimony, teaching, and example. It is not discovered fresh each generation—it is **transmitted**.

---

## Part 2: Enoch's Call — From Weakness to Power

### The Pattern of Prophetic Inadequacy

When the Lord called Enoch, his response echoed Moses, Jeremiah, and Nephi:

> "Why is it that I have found favor in thy sight, and am but a lad, and all the people hate me; for I am **slow of speech**; wherefore am I thy servant?"
> — [Moses 6:31](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p31#p31)

Compare:
- Moses: "I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue" ([Exodus 4:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/4?lang=eng&id=p10#p10))
- Jeremiah: "I cannot speak: for I am a child" ([Jeremiah 1:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/1?lang=eng&id=p6#p6))
- Nephi: "I am a man, and am weak" ([2 Nephi 33:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33?lang=eng&id=p1#p1))

### The Lord's Response: Faith + Presence = Power

The Lord's answer to Enoch contains one of the most powerful promises in scripture:

> "Go forth and do as I have commanded thee, and no man shall pierce thee. **Open thy mouth, and it shall be filled**, and I will give thee utterance, for all flesh is in my hands."
> — [Moses 6:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p32#p32)

Then comes the youth theme for 2026:

> "Behold my Spirit is upon you, wherefore all thy words will I justify; and the **mountains shall flee before you**, and the rivers shall turn from their course; and **thou shalt abide in me, and I in you; therefore walk with me.**"
> — [Moses 6:34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p34#p34)

### Faith Becomes Sight: The Seer

> "Anoint thine eyes with clay, and wash them, and thou shalt see."
> — [Moses 6:35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p35#p35)

After obeying this unusual command, Enoch "beheld the spirits that God had created; and he beheld also things which were not visible to the natural eye" ([v. 36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng)).

**Connection to [intelligence-01.md](intelligence-01.md):** This is spiritual creation becoming visible—the pre-mortal realm of organized intelligences that D&C 93:29 describes. Enoch saw what we study theoretically.

---

## Part 3: The Fall and the Plan — God's Message to Adam

Moses 6:48-68 contains the clearest pre-Christian statement of the plan of salvation in all scripture. It answers Adam's question: **"Why is it that men must repent and be baptized in water?"** ([v. 53](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng))

### The Problem: The Fall's Effects

| Verse | Teaching | Implication |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| [6:48](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng) | "Because that Adam fell, we are" | We exist because of the Fall |
| [6:48](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng) | "By his fall came death" | Mortality and spiritual death enter |
| [6:49](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng) | "Men have become carnal, sensual, and devilish" | Natural man is separated from God |
| [6:49](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng) | "Shut out from the presence of God" | The veil; spiritual death |

### The Solution: The Gospel of Jesus Christ

God teaches Adam the complete gospel in [verses 52-62](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng):

| Principle | Verse | Key Phrase |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Faith** | [6:52](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng) | "If thou wilt turn unto me, and hearken unto my voice, and believe" |
| **Repentance** | [6:52](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng) | "Repent of all thy transgressions" |
| **Baptism** | [6:52](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng) | "Be baptized, even in water, in the name of mine Only Begotten Son" |
| **Holy Ghost** | [6:52](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng) | "Ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost" |

### The Doctrine of Christ's Name

> "Jesus Christ, the **only name** which shall be given under heaven, whereby salvation shall come unto the children of men"
> — [Moses 6:52](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p52#p52)

This matches the Book of Mormon's emphasis on the name of Christ:
- "There is none other name given whereby salvation cometh" ([Mosiah 5:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5?lang=eng&id=p8#p8))
- "There shall be no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come" ([Mosiah 3:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3?lang=eng&id=p17#p17))
- "There is no other name given under heaven save it be this Jesus Christ" ([2 Nephi 25:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25?lang=eng&id=p20#p20))

---

## Part 4: The Comforter — Light, Truth, Intelligence

This is where Moses 6 directly connects to our D&C 93 study:

> "Therefore it is given to abide in you; the **record of heaven**; the **Comforter**; the peaceable things of immortal glory; the **truth of all things**; that which **quickeneth all things**, which **maketh alive all things**; that which **knoweth all things**, and hath all power according to wisdom, mercy, truth, justice, and judgment."
> — [Moses 6:61](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p61#p61)

### Connection to D&C 93

| Moses 6:61 | D&C 93 | Connection |
|------------|--------|------------|
| "Truth of all things" | [93:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng): "Truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come" | Same definition |
| "Quickeneth all things" | [93:33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng): "Spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy" | The Spirit makes alive |
| "Knoweth all things" | [93:36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng): "The glory of God is intelligence" | Intelligence = light = truth |

**The Comforter is described as possessing the attributes of intelligence itself**—truth, knowledge, power, quickening (making alive). This is what abides in the faithful.

---

## Part 5: Adam's Baptism — Born Again

### The Physical Act

> "Adam cried unto the Lord, and he was caught away by the Spirit of the Lord, and was carried down into the water, and was **laid under the water**, and was brought forth out of the water."
> — [Moses 6:64](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p64#p64)

This confirms immersion as the mode of baptism from the very beginning.

### The Spiritual Transformation

> "The Spirit of God descended upon him, and thus he was **born of the Spirit**, and became **quickened in the inner man**."
> — [Moses 6:65](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p65#p65)

### The Voice from Heaven

> "Thou art baptized with fire, and with the Holy Ghost. This is the record of the Father, and the Son, from henceforth and forever."
> — [Moses 6:66](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p66#p66)

### The Result: Sonship

> "Behold, thou art **one in me, a son of God**; and thus may all become my sons."
> — [Moses 6:68](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p68#p68)

This is the covenant path that brings us back to the Father. Adam was the first to walk it. We walk the same path.

---

## Part 6: All Things Bear Record of Christ

One of the most profound verses in Moses 6:

> "All things have their **likeness**, and all things are created and made to **bear record of me**, both things which are temporal, and things which are spiritual; things which are in the heavens above, and things which are on the earth, and things which are in the earth, and things which are under the earth, both above and beneath: **all things bear record of me.**"
> — [Moses 6:63](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p63#p63)

### Types and Shadows Everywhere

This means:
- Creation itself testifies of Christ
- Ordinances are symbols pointing to Christ
- Nature reflects spiritual truth
- Our collaboration patterns (intelligence organized by law) echo divine creation

## Personal Reflection Questions

1. **On Faith:** Lecture 1 says faith is the principle of action. How does Moses 6 demonstrate faith in action? (Consider Adam asking why baptism, then being "caught away" to the water.)

2. **On Calling:** Enoch felt inadequate—"slow of speech," "but a lad," hated by the people. When has the Lord asked you to do something beyond your perceived ability? How did He empower you?

3. **On Walking:** The Lord told Enoch, "Walk with me." What does it mean practically to walk with God in 2026?

4. **On Testimony:** Verse 63 says ALL things bear record of Christ. What unexpected thing in your life has testified of Him?

5. **On Transmission:** The command to "teach these things freely unto your children" ([6:58](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng)) suggests urgency. Why might it matter that these truths are taught **freely**—not grudgingly or sparingly?

## Teaching Outline for Sunday School

*Based on [Teaching in the Savior's Way](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teaching-in-the-saviors-way-2022?lang=eng) principles*

---

### Doctrine 1: God Calls the Weak and Makes Them Strong

**Principle:** The Lord calls imperfect people and empowers them to do His work. Our inadequacy is not a disqualifier—it's the starting point for grace.

**Scriptures:**
- [Moses 6:31-34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p31-p34#p31) — Enoch's call and the Lord's response
- [Ether 12:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) — "I give unto men weakness that they may be humble"
- [2 Corinthians 12:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) — "My grace is sufficient for thee"

**Discussion Questions:**
- What specific weaknesses did Enoch identify in himself? (slow of speech, young, hated by the people)
- What did the Lord promise would happen when Enoch opened his mouth?
- When have you felt inadequate for something the Lord asked you to do? What happened when you tried anyway?
- Why do you think the Lord consistently calls people who feel unqualified?

**Study Helps:**
- [Elder Bednar's talk "Abide in Me"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/04/57bednar?lang=eng) explains what it means to "walk with" the Savior
- The pattern of prophetic inadequacy appears with Moses ([Exodus 4:10-16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/4?lang=eng&id=p10-p16#p10)), Jeremiah ([Jeremiah 1:4-10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/1?lang=eng&id=p4-p10#p4)), and Moroni ([Ether 12:23-29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p23-p29#p23))
- 2026 Youth Theme: "Walk with Me" comes directly from [Moses 6:34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p34#p34)

**Invitation:**
This week, identify one thing the Lord has asked you to do that feels beyond your ability. Instead of focusing on why you can't, ask Him to open your mouth and fill it. Write down what happens.

---

### Doctrine 2: The Gospel Was Taught From the Beginning

**Principle:** Faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost are not New Testament innovations—they are eternal principles taught to Adam and passed through the generations.

**Scriptures:**
- [Moses 6:52](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p52#p52) — The first principles and ordinances taught to Adam
- [Moses 6:62](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p62#p62) — "This is the plan of salvation unto all men"
- [Moses 6:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) — The priesthood "was in the beginning, shall be in the end"

**Discussion Questions:**
- Why is it significant that Adam received the exact same gospel we have today?
- What does it mean that the priesthood existed "before the foundation of the world"?
- How does knowing the gospel is eternal (not just 2,000 years old) change how you view your covenants?
- Adam asked "Why must men repent and be baptized?" ([v. 53](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng)). Have you ever wondered that? What answer do you find in verses 53-62?

**Study Helps:**
- [Lectures on Faith 1](https://lecturesonfaith.com/1) claims faith was "taught unto the children of men" from the beginning—Moses 6:23 confirms it
- [D&C 107:40-54](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng&id=p40-p54#p40) gives the priesthood line from Adam through the patriarchs
- Genesis 5 gives ages; Moses 6 gives **doctrine**. Joseph Smith's translation reveals what was lost.

**Invitation:**
Read [Moses 6:51-62](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p51-p62#p51) as if you were Adam hearing it for the first time. What stands out? Consider teaching one truth from this passage to someone in your family this week—freely, as the Lord commanded ([v. 58](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng)).

---

### Doctrine 3: We Can Be Born Again and Become Sons/Daughters of God

**Principle:** Through faith, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, we are spiritually reborn—quickened in the inner person—and become children of Christ.

**Scriptures:**
- [Moses 6:59](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p59#p59) — "Ye must be born again into the kingdom of heaven"
- [Moses 6:65](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p65#p65) — Adam "was born of the Spirit, and became quickened in the inner man"
- [Moses 6:68](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p68#p68) — "Thou art one in me, a son of God; and thus may all become my sons"

**Discussion Questions:**
- What does it mean to be "quickened in the inner man"? (To be made alive spiritually)
- How is spiritual rebirth similar to and different from physical birth? (v. 59 draws the parallel: water, blood, spirit)
- Adam was already a literal spirit child of God. What additional meaning did "son of God" take on after his baptism?
- What does "thus may ALL become my sons" suggest about God's desire for us?

**Study Helps:**
- [Mosiah 5:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) — We become "children of Christ" through covenant
- [John 3:3-5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/3?lang=eng&id=p3-p5#p3) — Jesus teaches Nicodemus about being born again
- [D. Todd Christofferson's "Born Again"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2008/04/born-again?lang=eng) — Explains justification and sanctification

**Invitation:**
The voice from heaven told Adam he was "one in me, a son of God." That same promise is available to you through the same ordinances. This week, ponder what it means to be "one in Christ." Ask in prayer: "What would it take for me to feel that oneness more fully?"

---

### Doctrine 4: The Comforter Brings Truth, Life, and Power

**Principle:** The Holy Ghost is not just a feeling—He is the record of heaven, the truth of all things, and the power that quickens (makes alive) everything.

**Scriptures:**
- [Moses 6:61](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p61#p61) — Description of the Comforter's attributes
- [D&C 93:36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng&id=p36#p36) — "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth"

**Discussion Questions:**
- Look at all the attributes of the Comforter in verse 61. Which stands out to you most today?
- What does it mean that the Comforter "knoweth all things" and is "the truth of all things"?
- How does this description expand your understanding of the Holy Ghost beyond "a still small voice"?
- The verse says this is "given to abide in you." What conditions allow the Spirit to truly abide?

**Study Helps:**
- [D&C 93:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) defines truth the same way: "knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come"
- The Comforter possesses the same attributes as intelligence itself—this connects to our [intelligence study](intelligence-01.md)
- [John 14:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/14?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) — "The Comforter... shall teach you all things"

**Invitation:**
The Comforter is described as the one who "quickeneth all things" and "maketh alive all things." This week, notice moments when you feel spiritually alive, awake, or quickened. Thank Heavenly Father for those moments and ask for more.

## Closing Testimony

Moses 6 reveals that the path back to Father has always been the same: faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and the Holy Ghost. Adam walked it. Enoch walked it. We walk it still.

The Lord's invitation to Enoch is His invitation to us: **"Walk with me."**
