# Heavenly Mother and Heavenly Parents

## Overview

The doctrine of Heavenly Mother is a distinctive and sacred teaching of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. While less frequently discussed than Heavenly Father, the existence of a Heavenly Mother is clearly implied by and doctrinally connected to the restored gospel's teachings about our divine nature, eternal families, and the plan of salvation.

## Key Doctrinal Statements

### The Family Proclamation (1995)

The foundational modern statement on heavenly parents comes from "The Family: A Proclamation to the World":

> "All human beings—male and female—are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of **heavenly parents**, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny."

This proclamation explicitly uses the plural "heavenly parents," indicating both a Father and Mother in Heaven.

### The 1909 First Presidency Statement

In 1909, the First Presidency (Joseph F. Smith, John R. Winder, and Anthon H. Lund) issued a doctrinal statement titled "The Origin of Man" that explicitly mentions a Heavenly Mother:

> "All men and women are in the similitude of the **universal Father and Mother**, and are literally the sons and daughters of Deity."

This statement affirms:
1. The existence of both a universal Father AND Mother
2. Humans are created in their similitude (likeness)
3. We are LITERALLY their offspring

## General Conference References

### Direct References to Heavenly Mother

#### Elder Jeffrey R. Holland - "Behold Thy Mother" (October 2015)

In one of the most direct General Conference mentions of Heavenly Mother, Elder Holland paid tribute to mothers at all levels:

> "To all of our mothers everywhere, past, present, or future, I say, 'Thank you. Thank you for giving birth, for shaping souls, for forming character, and for demonstrating the pure love of Christ.' **To Mother Eve, to Sarah, Rebekah, and Rachel, to Mary of Nazareth, and to a Mother in Heaven, I say, 'Thank you for your crucial role in fulfilling the purposes of eternity.'**"

This statement:
- Places "Mother in Heaven" alongside honored scriptural mothers
- Acknowledges Her "crucial role" in eternal purposes
- Connects earthly motherhood to divine motherhood

**Source:** [Behold Thy Mother](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2015/10/behold-thy-mother?lang=eng)

#### President Marion G. Romney - "Man—A Child of God" (April 1973)

President Romney taught about the divine potential to become like our heavenly parents:

> "They reason that the same law is in force with respect to the offspring of God. Their objective is, therefore, to someday be like their **heavenly parents**."

> "He thinks of himself, as the scriptures teach, possessed of the innate ability, as are all other reproducing offspring, to reach in final maturity the status of his **heavenly parents** and have 'glory added upon [his] head for ever and ever.'"

**Source:** [Man—A Child of God](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1973/04/man-a-child-of-god?lang=eng)

### References to Heavenly Parents (Plural)

Multiple General Conference talks explicitly use the phrase "heavenly parents":

| Speaker | Conference | Quote |
|---------|------------|-------|
| President Dallin H. Oaks | [Apr 2020](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2020/04/51oaks?lang=eng) | "As spirits, we desired to achieve the eternal life enjoyed by our heavenly parents." |
| Elder D. Todd Christofferson | [Scripture Helps OT](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/scripture-helps-old-testament/01-moses-1-abraham-3?lang=eng) | "Prophets have revealed that we first existed as intelligences and that we were given form, or spirit bodies, by God, thus becoming His spirit children—sons and daughters of heavenly parents." |
| Sister Michelle Craig | [Oct 2020](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2020/10/14craig?lang=eng) | "Who we really are—sons and daughters of heavenly parents, with a 'divine nature and eternal destiny.'" |
| Elder Weatherford T. Clayton | [Oct 2020](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2020/10/27jackson?lang=eng) | "We are, after all, brothers and sisters, spirit children of our heavenly parents—literally." |
| Elder Neil L. Andersen | [Apr 2023](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen?lang=eng) | "Remember, you are a spirit child of Heavenly Father." |

## Scriptural Foundation

### Created in God's Image—Male AND Female

The scriptural foundation for Heavenly Mother begins with the creation account:

> "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; **male and female** created he them."
> — [Genesis 1:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/1?lang=eng&id=p27#p27)

This verse teaches:
- Both male AND female are created in God's image
- This implies divine patterns for both genders
- The plural "us" and "our" in Genesis 1:26 hints at multiple divine beings

### Spirit Children of God

The scriptures teach that we are God's spirit children:

> "Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto **the Father of spirits**, and live?"
> — [Hebrews 12:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/12?lang=eng&id=p9#p9)

> "We are the offspring of God"
> — [Acts 17:29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/17?lang=eng&id=p29#p29)

The Topical Guide entry for [Man, a Spirit Child of Heavenly Father](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/tg/man-a-spirit-child-of-heavenly-father?lang=eng) lists numerous scriptures affirming our divine parentage.

### Born as Spirits to Heavenly Parents

The Guide to the Scriptures entry on "Spirit" states:

> "Every person is literally a son or a daughter of God, **having been born as a spirit to Heavenly Parents** before being born to mortal parents on the earth."

## Mary as a Type and Shadow of Heavenly Mother?

### Exploring the Possibility

The question of whether Mary, the mother of Jesus, serves as a type and shadow of Heavenly Mother is a thoughtful theological inquiry. Consider these parallels:

#### Parallels Between Mary and Heavenly Mother

| Aspect | Mary | Heavenly Mother |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| **Motherhood** | Gave physical birth to the Son of God | Gave spirit birth to all God's children |
| **Divine Selection** | "Highly favored" and "blessed among women" (Luke 1:28) | A divine, exalted being |
| **Partnership** | Worked with Heavenly Father in the divine plan | Partners with Heavenly Father in eternal purposes |
| **Nurturing** | Nurtured, taught, and raised Jesus | Helped prepare spirits for mortality |
| **Selfless Love** | "Be it unto me according to thy word" (Luke 1:38) | Divine, selfless love for spirit children |
| **Present at Key Moments** | Present at birth, ministry, crucifixion | Role in premortal life, eternal progression |

#### Mary's Submission to Divine Will

Mary's testimony shows the pattern of divine motherhood:

> "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word."
> — [Luke 1:38](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/1?lang=eng&id=p38#p38)

**Referenced in:** [Elder Ronald A. Rasband, "Words Matter," Apr 2024](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2024/04/41rasband?lang=eng)

#### The Pattern of Earthly Motherhood

Elder Holland connected all motherhood to the divine pattern:

> "No love in mortality comes closer to approximating the pure love of Jesus Christ than the selfless love a devoted mother has for her child."

This suggests that every devoted mother reflects something of the Heavenly Mother's character.

**Source:** [Behold Thy Mother](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2015/10/behold-thy-mother?lang=eng)

### Considerations

While scripture doesn't explicitly state Mary is a "type" of Heavenly Mother, the parallels are meaningful:

1. **Both are divine instruments** in bringing God's children into existence (one spiritually, one physically for the Savior)
2. **Both exercise sacred creative powers** in partnership with divinity
3. **Both demonstrate perfect submission** to the Father's will
4. **Both are honored** in their respective roles

However, we should note:
- Scripture doesn't explicitly make this connection
- Mary was mortal; Heavenly Mother is exalted and divine
- This remains a matter for personal reflection and pondering

## The Divine Pattern of Parenthood

### Male and Female—Essential and Complementary

The Family Proclamation teaches:

> "Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose."

This implies that the male/female pattern exists not just on earth, but in the eternities—including among our Heavenly Parents.

### Equal Partners

> "Fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another **as equal partners**."

The earthly family pattern reflects the heavenly pattern—equal partnership between divine parents.

**Source:** [Elder Ronald A. Rasband, Oct 2025](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/10/21rasband?lang=eng)

## What We Know vs. What Remains Sacred

### Clearly Taught

1. **Heavenly Mother exists** - Affirmed by prophets and official Church statements
2. **We are Her spirit children** - "Sons and daughters of heavenly parents"
3. **She has a "crucial role"** in eternal purposes (Elder Holland)
4. **Both genders reflect the divine image** - "Male and female created he them"
5. **The family pattern is eternal** - Parenthood continues in exaltation

### Less Revealed

Details about Heavenly Mother's specific roles, interactions, or worship are not extensively revealed in scripture or official doctrine. This is believed to be due to the sacred nature of the topic.

---

## Implications for Our Lives

### Our Divine Nature and Destiny

Understanding Heavenly Parents helps us understand ourselves:

> "Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, **as such, each has a divine nature and destiny**."

We inherit divine potential from BOTH heavenly parents.

### The Potential to Become Like Them

President Romney taught that offspring naturally have the potential to become like their parents:

> "They reason that the same law is in force with respect to the offspring of God. Their objective is, therefore, to someday be like their heavenly parents."

**Source:** [Man—A Child of God](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1973/04/man-a-child-of-god?lang=eng)

### Motherhood as a Divine Calling

Mothers participate in the same sacred work as Heavenly Mother—bringing spirits into bodies and nurturing them toward eternal life. As Elder Holland said:

> "Mothers are... saviors on Mount Zion."

## Personal Reflection Questions

1. How does knowing I have Heavenly Parents (Father AND Mother) affect my understanding of my divine identity?
2. What divine attributes might I have inherited from a Heavenly Mother?
3. How does earthly motherhood reflect divine patterns?
4. What does it mean that BOTH male and female are created in God's image?
5. How might Mary's example teach us about divine feminine attributes?

---

## Summary

The doctrine of Heavenly Mother, while not extensively detailed in scripture, is clearly taught in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints through:

1. **Official proclamations** (The Family Proclamation, 1909 First Presidency statement)
2. **General Conference addresses** (Elder Holland, President Romney, President Oaks, and others)
3. **Logical extension of doctrine** (spirit birth, divine image, eternal families)

The existence of a Heavenly Mother is inseparable from our understanding of:
- Who we are (spirit children of heavenly parents)
- Our divine potential (to become like them)
- The eternal nature of gender and family
- The sacred nature of motherhood

While many details remain unrevealed, what we do know enriches our understanding of God's love, our identity, and our eternal destiny.
