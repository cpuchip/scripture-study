# Charity: The Pure Love of Christ

*Study Date: February 4, 2026*

## The Word Itself

Using the Webster 1828 dictionary alongside modern definitions reveals how dramatically the meaning of "charity" has shifted:

| Webster 1828 (Primary) | Modern (Primary) |
|------------------------|------------------|
| **Love; universal benevolence; good will** | An organization for helping the needy |
| Liberality in judging others | Giving money/goods to the poor |
| Putting the best construction on others' words | Benevolence, kindness |

In 1828, **charity was primarily about love**, with "almsgiving" listed third or fourth. Modern usage has inverted this—"charitable organization" is now the *first* definition most people think of.

This explains why Paul's teaching in [1 Corinthians 13:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) can seem paradoxical to modern ears:

> "Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor... and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing."

How can you give to charity and not have charity? Because **charity was never primarily about giving money**—it was about having Christ-like love.

## The Book of Mormon Definition

[Moroni 7:47](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7?lang=eng&id=p47#p47) gives us an explicit definition:

> **"But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him."**

[2 Nephi 26:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) states it even more plainly:

> "The Lord God hath given a commandment that all men should have charity, **which charity is love**."

The Book of Mormon preserves the original scriptural meaning that modern English has obscured.

## How Charity Is Obtained

The key insight from [Moroni 7:48](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7?lang=eng&id=p48#p48):

> "Wherefore, my beloved brethren, **pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart**, that ye may be filled with this love, **which he hath bestowed** upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God..."

Charity is not something we *generate*—it is **bestowed** as a gift from God when we pray for it with all our heart.

## Personal Reflection

*February 2026*

I spent 6 months praying for charity. My prayer began simply: "Please give me charity." 

Over time, my language transformed. I found myself praying to **see others as Christ sees them**.

That shift captures the essence of what charity actually is:

> **"It's about having Christ's own love dwell in us so we see others as He sees them."**

This isn't about writing checks to organizations (though generosity may flow from it). It's about vision—seeing with Christ's eyes, loving with His love.
