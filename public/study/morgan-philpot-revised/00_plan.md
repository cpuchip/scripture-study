# Morgan Philpot Revised — Study Plan

*A faith-centered reworking of the strongest scriptural insights from the Philpot evaluation project, combined with our own deep-read research and new discoveries.*

> *"Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection."* — [D&C 130:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130?lang=eng&id=p18#p18)

---

## Purpose

Morgan Philpot's "Signs of the Times" presentations contain genuinely excellent scripture work buried under date-setting and political predictions that will discredit the whole body when the dates pass. This project extracts what is *true and timeless*, adds our own research, and reframes it around faith rather than fear.

**Guiding principle:** The scriptures describe *patterns* of how God works — not a calendar of when He'll work next. Every dispensation has its Lachoneus, its Gadianton robbers, its faithful remnant. The power is in recognizing the pattern, not in naming today's cast.

**Approach:** Lawyer's perspective. Build the case from primary sources (scriptures, prophets, Hebrew/Greek), cite everything, follow the footnotes, and let the evidence speak. Opus 4.6 brings strong analytical and legal reasoning — we'll use that to construct arguments that would hold up under cross-examination.

## Proposed Study Documents

### Part 1: The Pattern of Appointed Times

**Thesis:** God operates on appointed times (mō·w·'ă·ḏîm), encoded in the feasts of Leviticus 23, the creation days of Genesis 1, and the agricultural rhythms of ancient Israel. The pattern is real — the specific modern calendar dates are not ours to know.

**Key scriptures to deep-read:**
- [Genesis 1:14-19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/1?lang=eng&id=p14-p19#p14) — lights for "signs, seasons, days, years" (with all footnotes)
- [Leviticus 23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/23?lang=eng) — the seven feasts (full chapter, follow every footnote)
- [D&C 88:42-45](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p42-p45#p42) — "given a law unto all things"
- [D&C 49:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) — "the hour and the day no man knoweth"
- [Matthew 24:32-36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/24?lang=eng&id=p32-p36#p32) — parable of the fig tree: know the *season*, not the day

**New angles to explore:**
- What does the Hebrew root יעד (yā·'aḏ) — "to appoint" — tell us about *how* God plans? Follow the root through the concordance.
- The Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot) as a Second Coming feast — scholarly and prophetic sources
- D&C 88's cosmological law language — do the "times and seasons" of v. 42 connect back to Genesis 1:14?
- Abraham 3's astronomy — Kolob, set times, governing stars. What does Abraham learn about divine timing?

**What we're NOT doing:** Mapping specific feasts to specific modern dates.

---

### Part 2: The Restoration Blueprint — JST Revelation 12

**Thesis:** JST Revelation 12's phrase "in the likeness of things on the earth" establishes a hermeneutic principle: heavenly patterns have earthly fulfillments. The Restoration *is* the earthly fulfillment of the war in heaven.

**Key scriptures to deep-read:**
- [JST Revelation 12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/jst/jst-rev/12?lang=eng) — the full JST text with footnotes
- [D&C 27:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/27?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) — Michael = Adam
- [D&C 107:53-57](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng&id=p53-p57#p53) — Adam-ondi-Ahman gathering
- [Daniel 7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/7?lang=eng) — beast kingdoms and the Ancient of Days
- [Daniel 12:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/12?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) — Michael stands up "at that time"

**New angles to explore:**
- The "woman" in Revelation 12 across all scripture: Genesis 3:15, Isaiah 54, Galatians 4:26, D&C 109. Build a composite portrait.
- The Council of Fifty historical record — what do the Joseph Smith Papers actually say? Legal/constitutional analysis of their charter.
- "Caught up unto God and to his throne" — compare the Ascension of Christ (Acts 1), translation of righteous beings (Moses 7, 3 Nephi 28), and Joseph's martyrdom. What's the *pattern*?

### Part 3: 3 Nephi as Second Coming Template

**Thesis:** 3 Nephi is the most detailed account of a *previous* coming of Christ to a covenant people. If we want to know what the Second Coming looks like, we study the template the Lord already gave us — not as a timeline to map onto modern events, but as a pattern of destruction, preservation, and divine appearance.

**Key scriptures to deep-read:**
- [3 Nephi 8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/8?lang=eng) — the destruction (storm AND tempest, with Webster 1828)
- [3 Nephi 9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9?lang=eng) — Christ's voice in the darkness: "will ye not now return unto me?"
- [3 Nephi 10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/10?lang=eng) — the silence, the hen gathering her chickens
- [3 Nephi 11:1-17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p1-p17#p1) — the appearance at Bountiful (with footnotes)
- [3 Nephi 17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17?lang=eng) — "my bowels are filled with compassion" — the emotional core

**New angles to explore:**
- **Who survived and why?** 3 Nephi 9:13 — "whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, him will I receive." Not bunkers. Not food storage alone. Broken hearts.
- **The hen metaphor** (3 Nephi 10:4-6) — trace this through Matthew 23:37, Luke 13:34, D&C 10:65. Christ's *desire* to gather vs. our *willingness* to be gathered.
- **Webster 1828 on "tempest" and "storm"** — extend the Philpot insight. What other 3 Nephi 8 words shift meaning under 1828 definitions?
- **3 Nephi 8:5 "first month, fourth day"** — the creation week / Passover connection. Does the text encode liturgical time?
- **The darkness as spiritual metaphor** — 3 Nephi 8:20-23. Three days of darkness. What are the footnote cross-references? What does "mist of darkness" connect to in 1 Nephi 8 and 12?

**The personal question:** If the destruction of 3 Nephi 8 happened to *my* city — would I be among those at Bountiful? What does my life look like right now if I'm honest? What needs to change?

### Part 4: Words That Change Meaning — A Legal Brief on Scriptural Language

**Thesis:** Many scriptural words carried different meanings in 1828 than they do today. Like a lawyer reading a statute under the law of the era it was enacted, we should read the Book of Mormon and D&C under the language of the era they were translated/received.

**Key words to study (Webster 1828 + modern comparison):**
- **Intelligence** — D&C 93:36 "the glory of God is intelligence" (already studied in [intelligence.md](../intelligence.md))
- **Receive** — what does it mean to "receive" Christ? (already studied in [receive.md](../receive.md))
- **Storm / tempest** — 3 Nephi 8 dual meaning (from Philpot's insight)
- **Virtue** — "who touched me? I perceive that virtue has gone out of me" — what did "virtue" mean?
- **Charity** — Moroni's extended definition vs. modern "giving to the poor"
- **Sorcery / sorceries** — Revelation 18:23 φαρμακεία (from Philpot's slide-only pharmakeia study, never spoken)
- **Broken** — Philpot's claim that Webster 1828 includes "bankrupt" — verify and explore
- **Quick / quicken** — "the quick and the dead" / "quickened by a portion of the celestial glory"
- **Suffer** — "suffer the little children" = "allow" in 1828? Or more?
- **Peculiar** — "a peculiar people" = exclusive/private possession, not "strange"

**Method:** For each word, run the webster-mcp `define` tool (1828 + modern side-by-side), then find every significant scriptural usage, and write a brief legal-style analysis of how the meaning shift changes our reading.

### Part 5: The Book of Mormon and the American Experiment

**Thesis:** The Book of Mormon *is* a book about America — not because modern events fulfill its prophecies on a year-by-year timeline, but because it was written *for* the people who would inhabit this land. The political patterns (secret combinations, Gadianton robbers, cycles of pride and destruction) are deliberately general enough to apply to *every generation* of American readers.

**Key scriptures to deep-read:**
- [Ether 2:8-12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p8-p12#p8) — the covenant of the promised land
- [3 Nephi 21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/21?lang=eng) — Christ's prophecy about the Gentiles on this land
- [Mormon 8:34-41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/8?lang=eng&id=p34-p41#p34) — Moroni's direct address: "I speak unto you as if ye were present"
- [D&C 98:4-10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98?lang=eng&id=p4-p10#p4) — constitutional law as "befitting all men"
- [D&C 101:76-80](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101?lang=eng&id=p76-p80#p76) — the Lord's purpose in establishing the Constitution

**New angles to explore:**
- **Legal analysis of D&C 98 and 101** — What constitutional principles is the Lord specifically endorsing? Are they structural (separation of powers) or substantive (individual rights)?
- **Ether 2's "decrees" language** — the promised-land covenant as divine statute law. What are the conditions and penalties?
- **Mormon 8:34-41 as closing argument** — Moroni *saw our day*. Verse 35: "I know your doing." Read this as a prophet's deposition testimony about what he witnessed in vision. What specific sins does he list?
- **The Gadianton pattern across dispensations** — not "Gadiantons = [political party]" but: what are the *structural features* that define a secret combination? Oaths, murder to get gain, infiltration of government (Helaman 6:38-39), and eventually "getting the sole management of the government" (Helaman 6:39). When you define the features precisely, you can recognize them without naming names.

### Part 6: Preparing a People — Faith Over Fear

**Thesis:** "If ye are prepared ye shall not fear" ([D&C 38:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38?lang=eng&id=p30#p30)). The scriptural preparation model is spiritual *first* and physical *second* — not because physical preparation doesn't matter, but because without the spiritual foundation, physical preparation becomes hoarding driven by fear rather than stewardship driven by faith.

**Key scriptures to deep-read:**
- [D&C 38:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) — "if ye are prepared ye shall not fear"
- [3 Nephi 9:13-14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p13-p14#p13) — broken heart and contrite spirit as the offering
- [3 Nephi 22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/22?lang=eng) — Isaiah 54 quoted by Christ: "thy Maker is thine husband"
- [D&C 45:56-57](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45?lang=eng&id=p56-p57#p56) — the wise virgins "had taken the Holy Spirit for their guide"
- [Matthew 25:1-13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/25?lang=eng&id=p1-p13#p1) — ten virgins (oil = the Holy Spirit you can't borrow)
- [Alma 34:32-34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34?lang=eng&id=p32-p34#p32) — "this life is the time to prepare to meet God"

**New angles to explore:**
- **What does "oil" represent?** Trace the olive oil metaphor through ancient Israel (anointing, temple lamp, healing) to the parable of the virgins to the olive harvest in Philpot's framework. Build the case that oil = personal relationship with the Holy Ghost.
- **The Nephite survivors' profile** — From 3 Nephi 9-10, build a composite of who the "more righteous part" were. What defined them? Geographic? Behavioral? Spiritual?
- **Nelson's urgency vs. Philpot's urgency** — President Nelson has said "time is running out." But his preparation counsel is hear Him, repent, temple, gather Israel. Compare that to Philpot's "be prepared to go by 2029." Same urgency, completely different substance.
- **Fear vs. faith as physiological states** — Moroni 8:16 "perfect love casteth out all fear." How does this play out practically? When does concern become fear? When does preparation become panic?

## Methodology

1. **Discovery** — gospel-mcp, gospel-vec, webster-mcp for initial searches
2. **Deep reading** — `read_file` every scripture chapter, follow every footnote chain
3. **Webster 1828** — historical definitions for every key term
4. **Legal reasoning** — treat scriptures as primary sources; build arguments from text, not inference
5. **Spirit-led** — if the Spirit says "follow this thread," we follow it, even if it wasn't in the plan
6. **Write for the family** — these documents should be readable by my spouse and eventually my children

## Execution Order

| Priority | Document | Why First |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Part 3: 3 Nephi as Template | Most personally urgent — this is where the fear→faith shift happened |
| 2 | Part 4: Words That Change Meaning | Builds tools we'll use in every other document |
| 3 | Part 1: Appointed Times | The strongest Philpot insight, reframed properly |
| 4 | Part 6: Faith Over Fear | The personal application capstone |
| 5 | Part 2: JST Revelation 12 | Deep exegesis — needs the language tools from Part 4 |
| 6 | Part 5: BoM and America | Most complex — needs all prior work as foundation |
