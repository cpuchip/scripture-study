# Teaching in the Savior's Way - Overview

*Study session: January 26, 2026*

## Purpose of This Study

Preparation for leading teacher council meetings and creating lessons that help teachers develop Christlike teaching skills. The Young Women presidency wants to focus on the first principle: **Focus on Jesus Christ**.

---

## Manual Structure

The manual is organized into three parts:

| Part | Focus | What It Covers |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **Part 1** | WHAT we teach | Focus on Jesus Christ |
| **Part 2** | HOW we teach | 4 Principles of Christlike Teaching |
| **Part 3** | APPLICATION | Settings, learners, teacher councils |

---

## Part 1: Focus on Jesus Christ

The central principle—no matter what topic you're teaching, you're really teaching about Jesus Christ.

### Two Components

#### 1. Teach About Jesus Christ No Matter What You Are Teaching
- Emphasize the **example** of Jesus Christ
- Teach about His **titles, roles, and attributes**
- Look for **symbols** that testify of Him

> "All things are created and made to bear record of me" — [Moses 6:63](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p63#p63)

#### 2. Help Learners Come Unto Christ
- Help learners **recognize** the Lord's love, power, and mercy in their lives
- Help learners **strengthen** their relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ
- Help learners **intentionally strive** to be more like Jesus Christ

**Key Insight:** It's not enough to *know about* the Savior—we must *experience* His power.

## Part 2: Principles of Christlike Teaching

### 1. Love Those You Teach

| Principle | Example from Christ |
|-----------|---------------------|
| See learners as God sees them | Zacchaeus - Jesus saw "a son of Abraham" where others saw a corrupt tax collector |
| Know their circumstances | Samaritan woman - Jesus knew her thirst was more than physical |
| Pray for them by name | "I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not" ([Luke 22:31-32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/22?lang=eng&id=p31-p32#p31)) |
| Create a safe environment | Jesus ate with sinners, praised a Roman soldier's faith |
| Express your love | Jesus stayed longer with the Nephites because He saw their need ([3 Nephi 17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17?lang=eng)) |

### 2. Teach by the Spirit

| Principle | Example from Christ |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Prepare yourself spiritually | 40 days in the wilderness |
| Respond to needs | Stopped mid-journey to heal the woman who touched Him |
| Create opportunities for Spirit | "Whom say *ye* that I am?" - invited personal revelation |
| Help recognize revelation | Oliver Cowdery: "Did I not speak peace to your mind?" |
| Bear testimony often | "Thy brother shall rise again" |

**Key Insight:** The Holy Ghost is the true teacher. We are instruments.

### 3. Teach the Doctrine

| Principle | Example from Christ |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Learn doctrine yourself | Jesus studied scriptures from youth |
| Teach from scriptures | Road to Emmaus - "Did not our heart burn within us... while he opened to us the scriptures?" |
| Help find truth | The lawyer and the Good Samaritan - guided to find his own answer |
| Focus on conversion | Sabbath teaching - not just rules, but the *purpose* of the Sabbath |
| Personal relevance | Parables that fit the listeners' circumstances |

### 4. Invite Diligent Learning

| Principle | Example from Christ |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Help take responsibility | Brother of Jared - "What will ye that I should do?" |
| Encourage daily study | "Rely upon the things which are written" |
| Invite preparation | Parable of the sower - good ground matters |
| Encourage sharing | Enoch - "I will give thee utterance" |
| Invite to live it | Sermon on the Mount - "Whosoever *doeth* them" |

## Part 3: Application for Teaching Youth

### Key Characteristics of Youth Learners

From [Suggestions for a Variety of Teaching Settings](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teaching-in-the-saviors-way-2022/12-part-3/13-suggestions-for-a-variety-of-teaching?lang=eng):

| Characteristic | Implication for Teaching |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| **Great potential** | Trust them. They will amaze you. |
| **Forming testimony** | Help them discover their own beliefs/convictions |
| **Learning through experience** | They need to reason and experience, not just be told |
| **Desire to be understood** | Good listening is critical |
| **Comfortable with technology** | Use as tools, not distractions |

> "If the youth sense that you trust them, their confidence in their divine potential will grow."

### What Youth Need

1. **Personal witnesses** - spiritual survival requires their own testimony
2. **Daily habits** - prayer, scripture study, service
3. **Participation** - in class and personal study
4. **Questions encouraged** - they're wrestling with real issues

## Key Takeaways for Our YW Lesson

### Focus on "Focus on Christ" Principle

The Young Women presidency wants to help teachers understand:

1. **Every lesson is really about Jesus Christ** - whether teaching about service, modesty, scripture study, or any topic

2. **Two dimensions:**
   - TEACH ABOUT Christ (His example, titles, symbols)
   - HELP LEARNERS COME UNTO Christ (experience His power, strengthen relationship, become like Him)

3. **Application for youth teachers:**
   - Youth are forming their testimony - help them *experience* Christ, not just learn *about* Him
   - Trust their potential
   - Listen well - they need to be understood
   - Help them recognize the Spirit when they feel it

### Questions for Lesson Discussion

- How does teaching about [any topic] become teaching about Jesus Christ?
- When have you helped a young woman experience the Savior's love, not just learn about it?
- How do you help youth recognize when the Spirit is testifying to them?
