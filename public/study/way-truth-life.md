# The Way, The Truth, The Life

*A study on Jesus Christ's triple declaration in John 14:6*

> "Jesus saith unto him, I am **the way**, **the truth**, and **the life**: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me." — [John 14:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/14?lang=eng&id=p6#p6)

---

## Context: The Upper Room Discourse

This statement comes during the Last Supper, as Jesus prepares His disciples for His departure. Thomas asks, "Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?" ([John 14:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/14?lang=eng&id=p5#p5)). Jesus responds not with directions but with Himself—He IS the way.

The setting is significant: Jesus has just instituted the sacrament, is about to enter Gethsemane, and will soon pass through the veil of death. He is about to become THE way to the Father.

## Question 1: Does This Point to the Tabernacle/Temple?

### The Three-Part Tabernacle Structure

The ancient tabernacle had three distinct spaces of increasing holiness:

| Space | Description | Access | Parallel |
|-------|-------------|--------|----------|
| **Outer Court** | Open space with altar of burnt offering and laver | All Israel could enter | Initial approach to God |
| **Holy Place** | Candlestick, shewbread, incense altar | Priests only | Daily service before God |
| **Holy of Holies** | Ark of the Covenant, mercy seat | High Priest, once yearly | Presence of God |

See: [Bible Dictionary: Tabernacle](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bd/tabernacle?lang=eng)

### The Veil Connection

The critical link is in **Hebrews 10:19-20**:

> "Having therefore, brethren, **boldness to enter into the holiest** by the blood of Jesus, By a **new and living way**, which he hath consecrated for us, **through the veil, that is to say, his flesh**"

The author of Hebrews explicitly connects:
- **THE WAY** = the "new and living way" through the veil
- **THE VEIL** = Christ's flesh (His mortal body/sacrifice)
- **THE DESTINATION** = "the holiest" (the presence of God)

When Christ died, "the veil of the temple was rent in twain" ([Matthew 27:51](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/27?lang=eng&id=p51#p51)), symbolizing that access to the Father was now open through Him.

Elder Patrick Kearon taught: "The veil of the temple was rent in twain when Jesus died upon the cross, symbolising that access back to the presence of the Father had been **ripped wide open**—to all who will turn to Him" — [God's Intent](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2024/04/45kearon?lang=eng)

### Christ as Both Priest and Sacrifice

In Hebrews 9, the tabernacle ordinances are shown as prefiguring Christ:

> "But Christ being come an **high priest** of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands... Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by **his own blood** he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained **eternal redemption** for us." — [Hebrews 9:11-12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/9?lang=eng&id=p11-p12#p11)

**Christ fulfills all three roles:**
- He is the **sacrifice** (the way to the altar)
- He is the **high priest** (the one who enters)
- He is the **way through the veil** (His flesh opening access)

---

## Question 2: Connection to the Modern Temple Endowment?

### The Endowment as Progressive Journey

The modern LDS temple endowment is perhaps the most direct application of this three-part progression. While the specific ordinances are sacred, the *pattern* mirrors the journey from fallen state to God's presence:

| Stage | State | Experience | Parallel |
|-------|-------|------------|----------|
| **Creation** | Paradisiacal | Adam and Eve in the Garden | Innocence, God's presence |
| **The Fall** | Telestial | Cast out, mortal world | Separation from God |
| **Law & Covenants** | Terrestrial | Savior taught, covenants made | Preparation, obedience |
| **Through the Veil** | Celestial | Pass through veil, enter celestial room | Return to God's presence |

This progression—from creation through fall, to redemption, to return—is the plan of salvation enacted physically in sacred space.

### The Veil in the Endowment

The temple has a literal veil that participants pass through. This mirrors:
- **Hebrews 10:20** — "a new and living way... through the veil, that is to say, his flesh"
- **The ancient tabernacle** — where only the high priest entered the Holy of Holies through the veil
- **John 14:6** — "no man cometh unto the Father, but by me"

Christ IS the veil. Passing through requires communing with Him, being found worthy through His merits, and entering into His presence.

### Abraham 4-5: The Creation Pattern

The endowment's creation narrative draws from [Abraham 4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/4?lang=eng) and [Abraham 5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/5?lang=eng), which use the language "the Gods" and emphasize the *planned* nature of creation:

> "And the Gods took counsel among themselves and said: Let us go down and form man in our image" — [Abraham 4:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/4?lang=eng&id=p26#p26)

This council setting frames the entire plan: creation → fall → redemption → exaltation. The endowment teaches this plan experientially, moving participants through each stage physically and spiritually.

---

## Question 3: Connection to the Three Degrees of Glory?

### The Three Kingdoms

Joseph Smith's vision ([D&C 76](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng)) revealed three kingdoms of glory:

| Kingdom | Glory | Comparison | Description |
|---------|-------|------------|-------------|
| **Telestial** | Stars | Outer Court? | Those who receive not the gospel nor testimony of Jesus |
| **Terrestrial** | Moon | Holy Place? | Honorable, but not valiant in testimony of Jesus |
| **Celestial** | Sun | Holy of Holies? | Those who overcome by faith, sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise |

### "In My Father's House Are Many Mansions"

Significantly, just before declaring "I am the way, the truth, and the life," Jesus says:

> "In my Father's house are **many mansions**: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to **prepare a place** for you." — [John 14:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/14?lang=eng&id=p2#p2)

The footnote references [D&C 98:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) and connects to "Telestial Glory" in the Topical Guide—suggesting John 14 itself anticipates the multiple kingdoms revelation.

### A Possible Progressive Framework

If we overlay the three-part phrase onto the endowment progression:

| Phrase | Temple Stage | Kingdom | Meaning |
|--------|--------------|---------|---------|
| **The Way** | Fall → Law given | Telestial → Terrestrial | Beginning the journey, learning the path back |
| **The Truth** | Covenants made | Terrestrial | Receiving light, knowledge, promises |
| **The Life** | Through the veil → Celestial room | Celestial | Entering God's presence, eternal life |

The endowment enacts this journey: we learn THE WAY (the plan, the covenants), we receive THE TRUTH (instruction, knowledge, promises), and we are brought to THE LIFE (God's presence in the celestial room).

## Question 4: How Does Each Represent Jesus Christ?

### Jesus as "The Way"

**The Path, The Door, The Gate**

> "I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture." — [John 10:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/10?lang=eng&id=p9#p9)

Elder Uchtdorf's research note: "The image of a path or way in the Hebrew Bible often stood for keeping the commandments or teachings of God... Paul and the first Christians also called themselves 'follower[s] of the Way'" — [Daily Restoration](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2021/10/41uchtdorf?lang=eng) (footnote 1)

Christ as "the way" means:
- **He is the example** we follow (see footnote 6a in John 14)
- **He is the door** through which we enter ([John 10:7-9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/10?lang=eng&id=p7-p9#p7))
- **He is the path** to righteousness ([Psalm 16:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/16?lang=eng&id=p11#p11))

**Scriptures:**
- [Exodus 33:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/33?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) — "shew me now thy way, that I may know thee"
- [Psalm 25:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/25?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) — "Shew me thy ways, O Lord; teach me thy paths"
- [Acts 24:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/24?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) — "after the way which they call heresy, so worship I"

---

### Jesus as "The Truth"

**The Revealer, The Word, The Light**

> "Truth is **knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come**" — [D&C 93:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng&id=p24#p24)

Christ as "the truth" means:
- **He reveals the Father** — "he that hath seen me hath seen the Father" ([John 14:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/14?lang=eng&id=p9#p9))
- **He is the Word** — "In the beginning was the Word... and the Word was God" ([John 1:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/1?lang=eng&id=p1#p1))
- **He embodies all truth** — "He received a fulness of truth" ([D&C 93:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng&id=p26#p26))

The Savior doesn't just *teach* truth—He IS truth personified. Everything about His nature, character, and works IS the standard of what is real and right.

**Scriptures:**
- [D&C 93:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) — "He received a fulness of truth, yea, even of all truth"
- [John 1:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/1?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) — "full of grace and truth"
- [John 18:37](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/18?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) — "for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth"

---

### Jesus as "The Life"

**The Resurrection, The Source of Eternal Life**

> "I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live" — [John 11:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/11?lang=eng&id=p25#p25)

Christ as "the life" means:
- **He is the source of physical life** — "in him was life" ([John 1:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/1?lang=eng&id=p4#p4))
- **He is the source of eternal life** — "this is life eternal, that they might know thee" ([John 17:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/17?lang=eng&id=p3#p3))
- **He conquered death** — "I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore" ([Revelation 1:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/1?lang=eng&id=p18#p18))

Without Christ, there is no resurrection, no eternal life, no continuation of consciousness. He holds the keys to life itself.

**Scriptures:**
- [John 5:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/5?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) — "the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself"
- [John 6:51](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/6?lang=eng&id=p51#p51) — "I am the living bread... if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever"
- [3 Nephi 9:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) — "I am the light and the life of the world"

---

## Question 4: Are These Building Blocks?

### A Progressive Sequence

Yes—these three phrases appear to build upon each other:

**1. THE WAY** (beginning)
- Implies a *journey* — you must start somewhere
- Points to *obedience* — following a path
- Requires *faith* — trusting the direction before seeing the destination

**2. THE TRUTH** (middle)
- Implies *understanding* — knowing what is real
- Points to *knowledge* — light and revelation along the way
- Requires *continued learning* — growing in truth

**3. THE LIFE** (culmination)
- Implies *arrival* — reaching the destination
- Points to *eternal life* — dwelling with God
- Results in *fulness* — complete joy, exaltation

### Grace for Grace Progression

This mirrors the pattern in [D&C 93:12-13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng&id=p12-p13#p12):

> "And I, John, saw that he received not of the fulness at the first, but received grace for grace; And he received not of the fulness at first, but **continued from grace to grace**, until he received a fulness"

We progress:
- **First:** Enter the way (repentance, baptism, covenant)
- **Then:** Grow in truth (receive the Holy Ghost, temple ordinances)
- **Finally:** Receive life (endure to the end, exaltation)

### The "I Am" Statements as Building Blocks

Christ's seven "I Am" statements in John may also build progressively:

| Statement | Reference | Meaning |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| I am the **Bread of Life** | [John 6:35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/6?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) | Spiritual nourishment, foundation |
| I am the **Light of the World** | [John 8:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/8?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) | Guidance, revelation |
| I am the **Door** | [John 10:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/10?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) | Entry, access |
| I am the **Good Shepherd** | [John 10:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/10?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) | Care, protection |
| I am the **Resurrection and the Life** | [John 11:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/11?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) | Victory over death |
| I am the **Way, Truth, and Life** | [John 14:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/14?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) | Complete access to Father |
| I am the **True Vine** | [John 15:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/15?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) | Abiding relationship |

## Questions for Meditation

1. When I enter the temple, am I conscious that I am walking "the way" Christ opened?

2. How does understanding Christ as "the truth" change how I approach studying the gospel?

3. What does it mean that Christ doesn't just *show* the way but IS the way? That He doesn't just *teach* truth but IS truth?

4. If the tabernacle's three spaces represent my journey, which space am I currently in spiritually?

5. How does the veil being rent give me "boldness" to approach God? ([Hebrews 10:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/10?lang=eng&id=p19#p19))

6. "No man cometh unto the Father, but by me" — What does this exclusivity tell us about the necessity of Christ?

---

## Summary

The triple phrase "the way, the truth, and the life" is far more than poetic language. It:

1. **Points to the ancient tabernacle** — Christ is the "new and living way" through the veil, fulfilling what the tabernacle shadowed
2. **Is enacted in the modern temple endowment** — The progression from fall → covenants → celestial room mirrors the journey from telestial to celestial, with Christ as the way through the veil
3. **Relates to kingdoms of glory** — These three concepts represent progressive stages toward celestial glory
4. **Comprehensively declares Christ's nature** — He is our path (way), our knowledge (truth), and our destination (life)
5. **Builds progressively** — We enter the way, grow in truth, and receive eternal life

The temple endowment is the living enactment of John 14:6. We begin in a fallen state, learn the way back (covenants), receive truth (instruction and promises), and are brought to life (passing through the veil into the celestial room—symbolic of returning to God's presence).

Most profoundly, Jesus doesn't simply *show* these things—He IS them. The veil we pass through is His flesh ([Hebrews 10:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/10?lang=eng&id=p20#p20)). There is no alternative path, no other source of truth, no other source of life. To come to the Father, we must come through Him.

> "He is **the Way**, the Truth, and the Life—no one can return to the Father except by Him. Jesus is the only way!" — [How Do I Know If I Really Know?](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/10/53schmitt?lang=eng)
