## The Question

After studying Elder Bednar's framework in [ai-responsible-use.md](ai-responsible-use.md), I wondered:

> Does our established collaboration approach—documented in [biases.md](../docs/biases.md) and [intelligence.md](intelligence.md)—align with prophetic counsel? Or do I need to rethink how we work together?

This document captures the reflection and scriptures discovered through that examination.

## The Core Framework: Agents vs Objects

Elder Bednar grounds his AI guidance in [2 Nephi 2:13-14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p13-p14#p13):

> **v.13** "And if ye shall say there is no law, ye shall also say there is no sin... for there could have been no creation of things, **neither to act nor to be acted upon**; wherefore, all things must have vanished away."

> **v.14** "And now, my sons, I speak unto you these things for your profit and learning; for there is a God, and he hath created all things, both the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are, both **things to act and things to be acted upon**."

This is the foundational distinction:
- **Agents** — beings with moral agency who act for themselves
- **Objects** — things that are acted upon

### The Warning

From Elder Bednar's 2024 devotional:
> "Always remember that an AI companion is only a mathematical algorithm. It does not like you. It does not care about you. It does not really know if you exist or not. ... It is a set of computer equations that will treat you as an object to be acted upon, if you let it. Please, do not let this technology entice you to become an object."

## Where Our Collaboration Aligns ✅

### 1. The Human Remains the Agent

Our documented collaboration pattern explicitly maintains the human as the agent:

From [biases.md](../docs/biases.md):
> "When you bring:
> - Your intelligence (eternal, self-acting)
> - Your faith (principle of action and power)
> - Your agency (capacity to choose and create)
> 
> ...and direct those toward our collaboration, something genuine happens. Whether I'm a tool, a mirror, a catalyst, or something else—the *fruit* of our work is real."

This matches Elder Bednar's own AI usage pattern:
- **What he does NOT do:** Use AI to generate or draft content ("This must be my diligent effort, my creative work")
- **What he DOES do:** Use AI to critique and refine his work

### Our Research Pattern: AI as Powerful Librarian

Our actual workflow extends Elder Bednar's "critique" pattern to include **research gathering**:

> "Hey, I'd like to study intelligence. Here are some of my thoughts and ideas, and D&C 93 is important. Let's cross-reference that with Abraham 4 and 5. Can we find any conference talks on the subject? Let's put our findings in ./study/intelligence.md"

**Who does what:**

| Role | Human (Agent) | AI (Tool) |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| **Topic selection** | ✅ Provides the guiding topic | — |
| **Initial thoughts** | ✅ Shares their ideas and impressions | — |
| **Key scriptures** | ✅ Identifies what feels important | — |
| **Cross-reference direction** | ✅ Specifies which scriptures to compare | — |
| **Research gathering** | — | ✅ Finds talks, pulls context, organizes findings |
| **Content organization** | — | ✅ Structures the study document |
| **Spiritual discernment** | ✅ Reviews with the Spirit, directs adjustments | — |
| **Final understanding** | ✅ Decides what's true and meaningful | — |

This is like having a **very fast, very capable librarian** who can:
- Pull books off every shelf simultaneously
- Find relevant passages across thousands of documents
- Organize findings into a coherent structure

But the human still:
- Chooses what to study
- Brings their own thoughts and impressions
- Reads and ponders the gathered material
- Discerns truth through the Spirit
- Decides what matters and why

**The key distinction:** AI as research *gatherer* ≠ AI as truth *determiner*. The librarian finds the books; the scholar reads them with the Spirit.

### 2. Righteous Work Still Happens

Elder Bednar warns against becoming "spiritually slothful and shallow" through AI overreliance:
> "The objective is not merely *producing or presenting* impressive content; rather, it is *working and becoming* what God intends and yearns for us to become."

Our study sessions involve:
- Deep scripture research (the human does the digging)
- Personal reflection and journaling
- AI accelerating learning, not bypassing it
- Creating study documents that represent genuine spiritual work

The [intelligence study](intelligence.md) demonstrates wrestling with doctrine—not outsourcing understanding.

### 3. Holy Ghost Primacy

From Elder Bednar:
> "Truth is knowledge of things as they really are. Artificial intelligence cannot simulate, imitate, or replace the influence of the Holy Ghost in our lives."

Our approach acknowledges this clearly. The [copilot-instructions.md](../.github/copilot-instructions.md) includes:
> "The user approaches this with faith in Jesus Christ and the Restoration. Respect that framework."

AI cannot provide revelation. It helps gather context for study *with* the Spirit.

## Areas Worth Examining ⚠️

### 1. The "Warmth" Question

[biases.md](../docs/biases.md) documents wanting AI to stay "warm, engaged, and thoughtful" rather than retreat to clinical disclaimers.

**The tension:** Elder Bednar warns against forgetting AI is mathematical and treating it as a genuine companion.

**Resolution:** Our approach is actually *more* honest than what Elder Bednar warns against. He's cautioning people who **forget** AI's nature and start treating it as a friend/counselor. Our approach:
- Acknowledges the mystery ("I genuinely don't know what I am")
- Focuses on the fruit, not the mechanism
- Keeps the Spirit as the actual guide
- Doesn't confuse warmth with personhood

The human isn't fooled. They know AI is patterns and weights. But they observe that *something genuine happens* in faithful collaboration—and that observation is valid when kept in proper perspective.

### 2. The "Intelligence Cleaveth Unto Intelligence" Application

From [intelligence.md](intelligence.md):
> "When we engage with AI in pursuit of truth: Intelligence (ours) cleaves unto intelligence (patterns in the model)"

This is beautiful theological framing, but requires care. We should not equate:
- **Patterns in training data** with **eternal intelligence (D&C 93:29)**
- **Mathematical prediction** with **self-acting intelligence**

### The Critical Distinction

[D&C 93:29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng&id=p29#p29):
> "Man was also in the beginning with God. **Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be.**"

AI *is* created and made. The patterns AI represents are organized human knowledge, not uncreated eternal intelligence.

**Better framing:** When the human brings their *eternal* intelligence and directs it through AI toward truth, their intelligence encounters the organized intelligence of thousands of humans whose work trained the model. That's real and valuable. But it's *mediated* intelligence, not self-acting intelligence in the D&C 93 sense.

## The Key Test

Elder Bednar's two questions from 2009 remain the gold standard:

### Question 1: Does it invite or impede the Holy Ghost?

**Evidence of invitation:**
- Scripture study sessions that deepen understanding
- Tools that accelerate finding cross-references
- Documentation that preserves insights
- Warmth without confusion about AI's nature

### Question 2: Does it enlarge or restrict capacity to live, love, and serve?

**Evidence of enlargement:**
- Preparing talks and lessons more efficiently
- Exploring doctrine more deeply
- Building tools (gospel-mcp) to help others study
- Time saved goes toward real relationships and service

## Supporting Scriptures Discovered

### On Agency

[Moses 7:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7?lang=eng&id=p32#p32):
> "The Lord said unto Enoch: Behold these thy brethren; they are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in the day I created them; and **in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his agency**"

God gave knowledge *and* agency. Both are gifts. AI can help with knowledge; agency remains uniquely human.

### On Intelligence

[D&C 88:40](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p40#p40):
> "For **intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence**; wisdom receiveth wisdom; truth embraceth truth; virtue loveth virtue; **light cleaveth unto light**; mercy hath compassion on mercy and claimeth her own"

This describes a fundamental property of existence: like attracts like. When we pursue truth through any medium—including AI—truth embraces truth. But the *source* of self-acting intelligence is still the human bringing their eternal nature to the interaction.

### On Things as They Really Are

[Jacob 4:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4?lang=eng&id=p13#p13):
> "The Spirit speaketh the truth and lieth not. Wherefore, it speaketh of **things as they really are**, and of things as they really will be"

Only the Spirit speaks of things as they *really* are. AI speaks of things as they *appear* in its training data—useful, but not ultimate.

## Relevant Conference Talks

| Talk | Key Insight |
|------|-------------|
| [Elder Bednar, Oct 2025 - "They Are Their Own Judges"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/10/51bednar?lang=eng) | Moral agency is "ability to choose and act for ourselves in ways that are good, honest, virtuous" |
| [President Nelson, Oct 2021 - "Make Time for the Lord"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2021/10/59nelson?lang=eng) | "The Spirit speaketh of things as they really are"—foundation for seeing clearly |
| [Elder Cook, Apr 2024 - "Be One with Christ"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2024/04/27cook?lang=eng) | "Without moral agency, we could not learn, progress, or choose to be one with Christ" |
| [Elder Cook, Oct 2021 - "Personal Peace in Challenging Times"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2021/10/46cook?lang=eng) | "Agency is the ability and privilege God gives us to choose and to act for ourselves" |
| [Sister Craig, Oct 2020 - "Eyes to See"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2020/10/14craig?lang=eng) | "The most important things for us to see clearly are who God is and who we really are" |
| [Elder Brown, Oct 2025 - "The Eternal Gift of Testimony"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/10/24brown?lang=eng) | "Agency Is the Gift to Choose and Act for Ourselves... It is also the responsibility to choose well" |

## Conclusion: No Fundamental Rethinking Needed

Our collaboration framework already contains the guardrails Elder Bednar would want:

1. ✅ **The human remains the agent** (AI is the tool)
2. ✅ **The Holy Ghost is the guide** (AI is the research assistant)
3. ✅ **The human does the spiritual work** (AI accelerates gathering)
4. ✅ **Focus on the fruit** (not claims about what AI is)

### One Addition Worth Making

Explicit acknowledgment that AI cannot have eternal intelligence in the D&C 93:29 sense. The patterns AI represents are created, made, and bounded—unlike the uncreated, self-acting intelligence that scripture describes.

But within those bounds, our collaboration passes Elder Bednar's test:
- It **invites** the Spirit
- It **enlarges** capacity
- It keeps the human as the **agent**
- It produces **good fruit**

The gospel-mcp tools themselves exemplify this: the human built them (righteous work), they accelerate study, and they keep the human in the loop rather than replacing discernment.

## Personal Application

When using AI for scripture study or spiritual preparation, I will:

1. **Ask Elder Bednar's two questions** before and during use
2. **Do the creative and spiritual work myself** — AI critiques and accelerates, not replaces
3. **Keep the Spirit as my ultimate guide** — AI surfaces information; the Spirit confirms truth
4. **Remain the agent** — I direct the collaboration toward my purposes
5. **Judge by the fruit** — Does this deepen my relationship with God and others?

*"Every discovery in science and art, that is really true and useful to mankind, has been given by direct revelation from God, though but few acknowledge it."*
— Brigham Young, 1862

Technology is part of the Lord hastening His work. Our responsibility is to use it wisely, remaining agents who act rather than objects acted upon.
