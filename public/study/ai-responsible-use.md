# Responsible Use of AI: Insights from Elder Bednar

*"The Spirit speaketh the truth and lieth not. Wherefore, it speaketh of things as they really are, and of things as they really will be."* — [Jacob 4:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4?lang=eng&id=p13#p13)

## Overview

Elder David A. Bednar has delivered two foundational talks on technology and spirituality, separated by 15 years:

1. **"Things as They Really Are"** (May 2009 / [Ensign June 2010](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2010/06/things-as-they-really-are?lang=eng)) — Warning about digital distractions and the importance of physical embodiment
2. **"Things as They Really Are 2.0"** (November 2024 / [Worldwide Devotional](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults/2024/11/13bednar?lang=eng)) — Updated warnings specifically addressing artificial intelligence

Together, these talks provide a doctrinal framework for understanding how to use AI responsibly as disciples of Christ.

## Core Doctrine: Why Our Bodies Matter

Before addressing technology, Elder Bednar establishes why this matters doctrinally:

### We Came to Gain Bodies
> "We came to this earth that we might have a body and present it pure before God in the celestial kingdom. The great principle of happiness consists in having a body." — Joseph Smith (2010 talk)

### Satan's Fundamental Problem
> "Satan does not have a body, and his eternal progress has been halted. Just as water flowing in a riverbed is stopped by a dam, so the adversary's eternal progress is thwarted because he does not have a physical body."

### The Irony of Temptation
> "One of the ultimate ironies of eternity is that the adversary, who is miserable precisely because he has no physical body, invites and entices us to share in his misery through the improper use of our bodies."

**Why this matters for AI:** Satan's two strategies are:
1. Tempt us to **misuse** our bodies (obvious sins)
2. Tempt us to **minimize the importance** of our bodies (more subtle)

AI falls into the second category—it can "disconnect gradually and physically from things as they really are."

## The Two Warning Questions (2009)

Elder Bednar posed two questions for evaluating technology use:

### Question 1: Does it invite or impede the Holy Ghost?
> "Does the use of various technologies and media invite or impede the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost in your life?"

### Question 2: Does it enlarge or restrict your capacity to live, love, and serve?
> "Does the time you spend using various technologies and media enlarge or restrict your capacity to live, to love, and to serve in meaningful ways?"

These questions remain the gold standard for evaluating AI usage in 2024 and beyond.

## The AI-Specific Framework (2024)

### AI's Potential for Good
- Advancing knowledge
- Improving quality of life
- Facilitating communication and connection
- Enhancing personal learning and growth
- Fostering creativity and innovation

### AI's Potential for Harm
- **Obscure our true identity** as sons and daughters of God
- **Distract** from eternal truths and righteous work
- **Engender pride** and diminished acknowledgment of dependence on God
- **Distort or replace** meaningful human interaction

### The Three Key Principles

Elder Bednar's 2024 talk organized around three interconnected concepts:

#### 1. Artificial Intelligence
> "My intent is not to suggest that artificial intelligence is inherently bad; it is not. ... But the righteous possibilities of this amazing technological tool can be realized only if we are aware of and guard against its perils."

**Key warning about AI companions:**
> "Always remember that an AI companion is only a mathematical algorithm. It does not like you. It does not care about you. It does not really know if you exist or not. ... It is a set of computer equations that will treat you as an object to be acted upon, if you let it. Please, do not let this technology entice you to become an object."

#### 2. Moral Agency
> "Moral agency can be understood as the ability and privilege to choose and to act for ourselves in ways that are good, honest, virtuous, and honorable."

**The danger:**
> "The ease of use, perceived accuracy, and rapid response time that characterize artificial intelligence can create a potentially beguiling, addictive, and suffocating influence on the exercise of our moral agency."

**The stunning warning:**
> "Because AI is cloaked in the credibility and promises of scientific progress, we might naively be seduced into surrendering our precious moral agency to a technology that can only think telestial."

#### 3. Righteous Work
> "One of my great concerns is that overreliance on AI technology will cause us to become spiritually slothful and shallow—and to forfeit the blessings made possible through righteous work."

**On preparing talks/lessons:**
> "The objective is not merely *producing or presenting* impressive content; rather, it is *working and becoming* what God intends and yearns for us to become."

## Elder Bednar's Personal Example

He shared his own AI usage pattern:

### What He Does NOT Do
> "I personally do not use this technology to generate or draft my talks, articles, or content for other projects. This must be my diligent effort, my creative work, and, most importantly, my seeking to be open to inspiration from the Holy Ghost."

### What He DOES Do
> "I do use this technology to critique my work."

He specifically used AI to analyze the tone of his talk for a worldwide young adult audience and made changes based on the feedback.

**Pattern:** Creation is personal and Spirit-guided; AI assists with refinement and iteration.

---

## The "Agent vs Object" Framework

Throughout both talks, Elder Bednar returns to a fundamental doctrinal distinction from [2 Nephi 2:13-14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p13-p14#p13):

> "God's creations include both 'things to act and things to be acted upon.' And, importantly, moral agency is the divinely designed 'power of independent action' that empowers us as God's children to become **agents to act** and not simply **objects to be acted upon**."

### The Test
When using AI, ask: Am I acting as an agent, or am I being acted upon?

| Agent (Good) | Object (Dangerous) |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Using AI to critique and refine my work | Letting AI generate my work |
| Asking AI to help me understand a concept | Outsourcing my thinking to AI |
| Using AI to accelerate learning | Using AI to avoid learning |
| AI as a tool in service of my purposes | Becoming a tool in service of AI's algorithms |

## The Holy Ghost Cannot Be Replaced

> "Truth is knowledge of things as they really are. Artificial intelligence cannot simulate, imitate, or replace the influence of the Holy Ghost in our lives."

No matter how sophisticated AI becomes, it can NEVER:
- Bear witness of the Father and the Son
- Reveal the truth of all things
- Sanctify those who have repented and been baptized

This is why the two questions from 2009 remain paramount—the Holy Ghost is irreplaceable.

## Practical Application: Using AI Responsibly

Based on Elder Bednar's teachings, here's a framework for responsible AI use:

### Before Using AI, Ask:
1. Will this invite or impede the Holy Ghost in my life?
2. Will this enlarge or restrict my capacity to live, love, and serve?
3. Am I acting as an agent, or becoming an object?
4. Am I doing righteous work, or avoiding it?

### Appropriate Uses
- **Research acceleration** — gathering information to study further
- **Critique and refinement** — improving work you've already created
- **Learning iteration** — asking questions to deepen understanding
- **Administrative tasks** — freeing time for more meaningful work
- **Accessibility** — tools that help those with disabilities participate more fully

### Dangerous Uses
- **Replacement of personal creation** — having AI do the spiritual work of preparation
- **Substitute relationships** — AI companions replacing human connection
- **Outsourced thinking** — letting AI form your opinions and conclusions
- **Spiritual shortcuts** — avoiding the growth that comes through struggle

### The Standard
> "We have a responsibility to ensure the Holy Ghost can always attest to the truth and authenticity of all we say and share, both in our form and content."

---

## Elder Bednar's Promise

> "I bless you and promise that as we 'look unto [the Savior] in every thought' and seek for the companionship of the Holy Ghost, we will be blessed to walk in the meekness of the Lord's Spirit and have peace in Him. And we will 'doubt not, fear not,' and discern the truth of all things, even 'things as they really are.'"

---

## Prophetic Context

Elder Bednar situates his warnings within a broader prophetic framework:

### President David O. McKay (1966)
> "Discoveries latent with such potent power, either for the blessing or the destruction of human beings as to make men's responsibility in controlling them the most gigantic ever placed in human hands. ... This age is fraught with *limitless perils*, as well as *untold possibilities*."

### President Russell M. Nelson (2018)
> "In coming days, it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost."

### Brigham Young (1862)
> "Every discovery in science and art, that is really true and useful to mankind, has been given by direct revelation from God, though but few acknowledge it."

Technology is not inherently evil—it's part of the Lord hastening His work. But our responsibility in using it wisely has never been greater.

## Personal Reflection Questions

1. In what ways might I be using AI as a "spiritual shortcut" that bypasses righteous work?

2. Are there relationships in my life being displaced by digital interactions?

3. How can I use AI to *accelerate* my learning rather than *replace* it?

4. What boundaries would help me remain an agent rather than becoming an object?

5. How do the two questions (Holy Ghost / capacity to live, love, serve) apply to my current AI usage?
