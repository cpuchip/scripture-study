## Scripture Foundation

> "And I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom. Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand."
> — [D&C 88:77-78](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p77-p78#p77)

> "The preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just—yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them—therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God."
> — [Alma 31:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&id=p5#p5)
