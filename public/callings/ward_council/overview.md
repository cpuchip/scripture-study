## How to Gather Information

As council members discuss matters, they consider the **needs and strengths** of the members they serve. Learn about these through:

- Presidency meetings in your organization
- Discussions with members of your organization
- Ministering interviews
- Your own ministering efforts
- [LCR tools and reports](https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org)

> **Important:** Council members must keep confidential any private or sensitive information. See [Handbook 4.4.6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/4-leadership-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng).

---

## Special Attention

The ward council should know the **children and youth** in the ward and their home circumstances. Pay particular attention to those who **do not have gospel support at home**.

---

## Sunday School-Specific Contributions

As Sunday School president, you can contribute to ward council by:

### 1. Reporting on Teaching Quality

### Discussion
> "Let one speak at a time and let all listen unto his sayings, that when all have spoken that all may be edified of all, and that every man may have an equal privilege."

- Seek to know the Lord's will

### Decisions
- The bishop may decide on a course of action or postpone for additional information

### Unity
> "Be one."
> — [D&C 38:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38?lang=eng&id=p27#p27)

- Seek to become one in desire and purpose with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ

## Scripture Foundation

> "Holding a meeting should never replace serving and ministering as Jesus Christ did. Ways to assist God in His work of salvation and exaltation can be planned in a meeting, but these are most often accomplished outside of the meeting."
> — [General Handbook 29.0](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/29-meetings-in-the-church?lang=eng)

> "And let every man esteem his brother as himself, and practise virtue and holiness before me. And again I say unto you, let every man esteem his brother as himself."
> — [D&C 38:24-25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38?lang=eng&id=p24-p25#p24)
