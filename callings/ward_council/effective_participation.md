# Effective Ward Council Participation

*Practical guidance for contributing meaningfully to ward council*

---

## The Mindset Shift

**Wrong mindset:** "I'm here to report on my organization."

**Right mindset:** "I'm here to help bless ALL ward members, bringing my unique perspective and also representing Sunday School needs."

> "Ward organization leaders attend ward council meetings in two capacities: (1) As members of the ward council who help bless all ward members. (2) As representatives of their organizations."
> — [General Handbook 29.2.5](../../gospel-library/eng/manual/general-handbook/29-meetings-in-the-church.md)

## What Makes Council Different from Committee

| Committee | Council |
|-----------|---------|
| Task-oriented | People-oriented |
| Report progress | Seek revelation |
| Solve problems | Understand needs |
| Assign work | Coordinate efforts |
| Efficient meetings | Spirit-led discussions |

Councils existed before the world was created. We participated in them in the premortal life. ([D&C 121:32](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.md); [Abraham 3:22-28](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.md))

## The Leader's Role vs. Your Role

**Bishop (Leader):**
- Plans, presides, conducts
- Guides discussions (but should listen more than talk)
- Decides on courses of action
- Ensures the Lord's purposes are accomplished

**Council Members (You):**
- Come prepared spiritually and informationally
- Share insights openly and honestly
- Listen respectfully to others
- Offer your unique perspective
- Accept and fulfill assignments
- Maintain confidentiality

## How to Contribute Effectively

### 1. Speak About People, Not Programs

**Less effective:** "Sunday School attendance has been low."

**More effective:** "I've noticed the Johnsons haven't been to Sunday School in three weeks. Does anyone know how they're doing? Sister Martinez mentioned she's been struggling to connect with the lesson material—I wonder if she's feeling spiritually dry."

### 2. Connect Others' Concerns to Teaching

When the Relief Society president mentions a member struggling, ask yourself:
- How could better gospel teaching help this person?
- Is there a way Sunday School could support this need?
- Should I follow up with this person's Sunday School teacher?

### 3. Bring the Teaching Perspective

You see the ward through a unique lens—how people **learn and engage** with the gospel. Share insights about:
- Who is engaged and growing spiritually
- Who seems disconnected or struggling
- What doctrine seems to resonate or confuse
- How class discussions reveal member needs

### 4. Ask Good Questions

Instead of offering solutions immediately, ask:
- "What do we know about their situation?"
- "Who has a relationship with this person?"
- "What has helped them in the past?"
- "How is the Spirit directing us?"

### 5. Think "And" Not "Or"

Ward council works best when organizations **collaborate** rather than compete for resources. Look for:
- How can Sunday School support what Young Women is doing?
- Can a teacher council meeting address concerns the Elders Quorum president raised?
- Should we coordinate a ward-wide teaching emphasis?

## Common Ward Council Topics and How You Can Help

### "We have several new members..."
**Your contribution:**
- Ensure they're in appropriate Sunday School classes
- Brief their teachers about their background
- Consider organizing a special class for new/returning members
- Follow up on their class experience

### "The youth seem disconnected..."
**Your contribution:**
- Talk to youth Sunday School teachers about engagement
- Observe youth classes and provide feedback
- Suggest principles from Teaching in the Savior's Way
- Ensure two-deep leadership is maintained

### "We're trying to help the Smith family..."
**Your contribution:**
- Mention if you've noticed them in Sunday School
- Share any insights about their spiritual engagement
- Ask their teacher to reach out

### "Temple attendance is low..."
**Your contribution:**
- Are temple and family history topics being taught effectively in Sunday School?
- Is there a need for a specialized class on temple preparation?
- How can teachers encourage temple worship?

### "Ministering seems inconsistent..."
**Your contribution:**
- Are we teaching the *why* of ministering in Sunday School?
- What doctrine supports ministering? Is it being taught?
- Can teacher council meetings address ministering as a teaching skill?

## The Big Picture

Ward council is not about meetings—it's about **people**.

> "Holding a meeting should never replace serving and ministering as Jesus Christ did. Ways to assist God in His work of salvation and exaltation can be planned in a meeting, but these are most often accomplished outside of the meeting."
> — [General Handbook 29.0](../../gospel-library/eng/manual/general-handbook/29-meetings-in-the-church.md)

The best ward councils:
- Focus on **individuals and families**, not programs
- Seek **revelation** together
- Act in **unity**
- **Follow through** on plans
- See **results** in changed lives

## Scripture Foundation

> "Let one speak at a time and let all listen unto his sayings, that when all have spoken that all may be edified of all, and that every man may have an equal privilege."
> — [D&C 88:122](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md)

> "And now, because of the steadiness of the church they began to be exceedingly rich, having abundance of all things whatsoever they stood in need... and thus they did prosper and become far more wealthy than those who did not belong to their church. And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, they did not send away any who were naked, or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, or that had not been nourished; and they did not set their hearts upon riches; therefore they were liberal to all."
> — [Alma 1:29-30](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/alma/1.md)
