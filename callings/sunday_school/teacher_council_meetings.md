# Teacher Council Meetings

*A guide to planning, leading, and maximizing the impact of teacher council meetings*

## What Are Teacher Council Meetings?

Teacher council meetings are quarterly gatherings where teachers (and/or parents) counsel together about principles of Christlike teaching. They use [Teaching in the Savior's Way](../../gospel-library/eng/manual/teaching-in-the-saviors-way-2022/01-introduction/03-purpose.md) as the primary resource.

> "In teacher council meetings, teachers counsel together about principles of Christlike teaching. They also counsel about how to improve gospel learning and teaching."
> — [General Handbook 17.4](../../gospel-library/eng/manual/general-handbook/17-teaching-the-gospel.md)

## Two Types of Teacher Council Meetings

| Type | Audience | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **For Called Teachers** | Teachers from quorums and organizations | Improve teaching in Church settings |
| **For Parents** | Parents in the ward | Improve gospel teaching at home |

Both types follow the same format and use Teaching in the Savior's Way.

## Who Is Responsible?

### Ward Council
- **Oversees** teacher council meetings
- **Schedules** when meetings are held
- **Determines** topics based on ward needs
- **Decides** which parents to invite (specific or open invitation)

> "The ward council oversees and schedules teacher council meetings."
> — [General Handbook 13.4](../../gospel-library/eng/manual/general-handbook/13-sunday-school.md)

### Sunday School Presidency
- **Usually leads** the meetings
- **Assists** the ward council in planning
- **Counsels** with ward council about teacher and learner needs
- **Determines** which principles from Teaching in the Savior's Way best meet those needs

> "A member of the Sunday School presidency usually leads the meetings. However, the bishopric may ask another member to lead them."
> — [General Handbook 13.4](../../gospel-library/eng/manual/general-handbook/13-sunday-school.md)

### Bishopric
- **May assign** someone other than Sunday School presidency to lead
- **Approves** the schedule and topics
- **Provides direction** on ward needs

---

## When Are They Held?

Teacher council meetings are held **quarterly** during the 50-minute class time on Sunday.

### Scheduling for Called Teachers

| Teachers | When They Attend |
|----------|------------------|
| Priesthood quorum, Relief Society, and Young Women teachers | First or third Sunday (when they're not teaching) |
| Sunday School teachers | Second or fourth Sunday (when they're not teaching) |
| Primary teachers | Any Sunday, as determined by Primary and Sunday School presidencies |

> "Teachers attend teacher council meetings on a Sunday when they are not teaching their regular class."
> — [Teaching in the Savior's Way](../../gospel-library/eng/manual/teaching-in-the-saviors-way-2022/12-part-3/17-teacher-council-meetings-for-parents-and-teachers.md)

### Scheduling for Parents
- **Any Sunday** as determined by the ward council
- Ward council determines whether to invite **specific parents** or make attendance **open to all**

### Primary Teacher Considerations
Primary teachers have flexible scheduling options:
- Attend with teachers from other organizations
- Meet separately during 20-minute Primary singing time
- Meet before/after regular Sunday meetings
- Meet on another day during the week
- Multiple quarterly meetings so not all miss Primary the same week

---

## Who Should Attend?

### For Called Teachers
- **All teachers** who teach a quorum or class in the ward
- **Quorum and organization presidency members** are also invited

### For Parents
- As determined by ward council:
  - Specific parents who could benefit
  - Open invitation to all parents

---

## Meeting Format (50 minutes)

The same format applies to both teacher and parent council meetings:

### 1. Share and Counsel Together (20 minutes)
Invite participants to share:
- What is working well in their teaching
- Challenges they are facing
- Things they would like to improve

**Leader's Role:** Facilitate discussion, listen more than talk, help teachers learn from each other.

### 2. Learn Together (15 minutes)
Discuss one of the principles from Teaching in the Savior's Way:
- Focus on Jesus Christ
- Love Those You Teach
- Teach by the Spirit
- Teach the Doctrine
- Invite Diligent Learning

Come, Follow Me may also be used as a resource.

**Leader's Role:** Present the principle, facilitate discussion, share examples, invite the Spirit.

### 3. Plan and Invite (10 minutes)
Invite participants to share:
- What they learned during the meeting
- How they plan to apply it

**Leader's Role:** Invite specific commitments, express confidence, offer support.

## What to Teach (Principles of Christlike Teaching)

Teaching in the Savior's Way teaches **five core principles**:

### Focus on Jesus Christ
- Teach about Jesus Christ no matter what you are teaching
- Help learners come unto Jesus Christ

### Love Those You Teach

- Create a safe environment
- Find appropriate ways to express your love

### Teach by the Spirit
- Prepare yourself spiritually
- Respond to spiritual promptings
- Create opportunities for learners to be taught by the Holy Ghost
- Bear testimony often

### Teach the Doctrine
- Learn the doctrine yourself
- Teach from scriptures and latter-day prophets
- Focus on truths that lead to conversion
- Help learners find personal relevance

### Invite Diligent Learning
- Help learners take responsibility for their learning
- Encourage daily gospel study
- Invite learners to prepare, share, and live what they're learning

## How Topics Are Determined

The ward council, with assistance from the Sunday School presidency, determines topics by:

1. **Identifying needs** of teachers and learners in the ward
2. **Counseling together** about what principles would help most
3. **Selecting** from Teaching in the Savior's Way

> "They counsel together about the needs of teachers and learners, and they work together to determine which principles from Teaching in the Savior's Way will best meet those needs."
> — [Teaching in the Savior's Way](../../gospel-library/eng/manual/teaching-in-the-saviors-way-2022/12-part-3/17-teacher-council-meetings-for-parents-and-teachers.md)

### Examples of Ward Needs and Matching Principles

| Ward Need | Consider Teaching |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Teachers report low engagement | "Invite Diligent Learning" |
| Members seem disconnected spiritually | "Focus on Jesus Christ" |
| Classes feel unwelcoming | "Love Those You Teach" |
| Discussions lack doctrinal depth | "Teach the Doctrine" |
| Lessons feel mechanical or scripted | "Teach by the Spirit" |
| Parents struggling with family scripture study | "Home and Family" section |
| New members need strengthening | "Love Those You Teach" |

## Preparing to Lead a Teacher Council Meeting

### Before the Meeting
1. **Pray** for guidance about what to discuss
2. **Review** the assigned principle in Teaching in the Savior's Way
3. **Think about** ward-specific applications
4. **Prepare** 2-3 discussion questions for each section
5. **Gather** any handouts or visual aids

### Opening Questions to Consider
- "What teaching experiences have you had recently that felt successful? What made them work?"
- "What challenges are you facing in your teaching right now?"
- "What do you wish you could do better?"

### During the Meeting
- Create a safe, supportive atmosphere
- Listen more than you speak
- Facilitate—don't lecture
- Let teachers learn from each other
- Bear testimony of the power of Christlike teaching
- Ensure everyone has opportunity to participate

### After the Meeting
- Follow up with teachers who mentioned specific challenges
- Report to ward council on what was discussed
- Note any needs that should be addressed in future meetings
