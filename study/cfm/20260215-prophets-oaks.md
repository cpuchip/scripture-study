# President Dallin H. Oaks: Warnings, Invitations, and Promised Blessings (2018–2025)

*Come Follow Me Supplement — Genesis 6–11; Moses 8 — "Noah Found Grace in the Eyes of the Lord"*

> "How is our living prophet like Noah? … What is he warning us about? And what is he inviting us to do?" — *Come, Follow Me* Manual

The following is drawn from **21 substantive general conference addresses** by President Oaks from April 2018 through October 2025 — first as First Counselor in the First Presidency, and from January 2025 as President of the Church. Every quote has been read from the source file.

## I. The Warnings

Where President Nelson sounds the alarm about spiritual survival and the adversary's escalating attacks, President Oaks focuses his warnings on the *mechanisms* of decline — the specific ways people lose their footing. His warnings are precise, doctrinal, and often framed in the language of a former judge who has seen the consequences.

### The Cumulative Power of Small Deviations

> "We are surrounded by media influences and cultural deteriorations that will carry us downstream in our values if we are not continually resisting. … **If we ever stop paddling, we will be carried downstream toward a destination we do not seek but which becomes inevitable if we do not constantly try to move forward.**" — [Small and Simple Things, April 2018](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2018/04/small-and-simple-things.md)

> "Some neglect weekly renewal of covenants by not partaking of the sacrament." — [Divine Helps for Mortality, April 2025](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/04/47oaks.md)

> Deviations occur "when members fail to follow the fundamental spiritual maintenance plan of personal prayer, regular scripture study, and frequent repentance." — [Divine Helps for Mortality, April 2025](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/04/47oaks.md)

### Unreliable Sources of Truth

> "We should not consider secular prominence or authority as qualified sources of truth. … One who is learned or celebrated in one subject is not qualified as an authority in another." — [Truth and the Plan, October 2018](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2018/10/truth-and-the-plan.md)

> "Not all of this information is true. We need to be cautious as we seek truth and choose sources for that search." — [Truth and the Plan, October 2018](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2018/10/truth-and-the-plan.md)

> "Those who once had spiritual vision can suffer from **self-inflicted spiritual blindness.**" — [Truth and the Plan, October 2018](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2018/10/truth-and-the-plan.md)

### Satan's Specific Methods

> "Satan seeks to destroy God's work. His prime methods are to **discredit the Savior** and His divine authority, to **erase the effects of the Atonement**, to **discourage repentance**, to **counterfeit revelation**, and to **contradict individual accountability**. He also seeks to **confuse gender**, to **distort marriage**, and to **discourage childbearing**." — [Truth and the Plan, October 2018](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2018/10/truth-and-the-plan.md)

### Contention as Satan's Tool

> "He that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention." — [Love Your Enemies, October 2020](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2020/10/17oaks.md) (3 Nephi 11:29)

> "**Anger is Satan's tool.** No one can *make* us angry. It is our choice." — [Love Your Enemies, October 2020](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2020/10/17oaks.md)

> "This is a time of many harsh and hurtful words in public communications and sometimes even in our families. Sharp differences on issues of public policy often result in actions of hostility—even hatred." — [Following Christ, October 2024](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2024/10/18oaks.md)

### The Decline of Family and Marriage

> "In the United States we are suffering from a deterioration in marriage and childbearing. For nearly a hundred years the proportion of households headed by married couples has declined, and so has the birthrate." — [The Family-Centered Gospel of Jesus Christ, October 2025](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/10/58oaks.md)

> "The marriages and birthrates of our Church members are much more positive, but they have also declined significantly. … **Latter-day Saint values and practices should improve—not follow—those trends.**" — [The Family-Centered Gospel, October 2025](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/10/58oaks.md)

### The Danger of Abandoning the Church

> "If we cease valuing our churches for any reason, we threaten our personal spiritual life, and significant numbers separating themselves from God reduce His blessings to our nations." — [The Need for a Church, October 2021](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2021/10/18oaks.md)

> Members who forgo Church attendance "forfeit their opportunity to qualify to perpetuate their family for eternity." — [The Need for a Church, October 2021](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2021/10/18oaks.md)

### The Parable of the Ten Virgins

> "Of those invited to meet Him, **only half will be prepared.**" — [Divine Helps for Mortality, April 2025](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/04/47oaks.md)

Specific examples of the unprepared: "returned missionaries who have interrupted their spiritual growth by periods of inactivity, youth who have jeopardized their spiritual growth by separating themselves from Church teaching and activities, men who have postponed their ordination to the Melchizedek Priesthood, men and women … who have departed the covenant path short of making and keeping covenants in the holy temple." — [Divine Helps for Mortality, April 2025](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/04/47oaks.md)

---

## II. The Invitations

### 1. Understand the Plan of Salvation

President Oaks returns to the plan of salvation more than any other theme. He sees it as the lens through which *everything* makes sense:

> "We who know God's plan and who have covenanted to participate have a clear responsibility to teach these truths and do all that we can to further them." — [The Great Plan, April 2020](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2020/04/51oaks.md)

> "An understanding of God's fabulous plan takes the mystery out of life and the uncertainty out of our future." — [Think Celestial!, October 2023](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2023/10/51nelson.md) (Nelson, echoing Oaks)

> "During this mortal life you get to choose which laws you are willing to obey—those of the celestial kingdom, or the terrestrial, or the telestial—and, therefore, in which kingdom of glory you will live forever." — [Kingdoms of Glory, October 2023](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2023/10/17oaks.md)

### 2. Love God *and* Your Neighbor — Keep Both Commandments

> "Our zeal to keep the second great commandment must not cause us to forget the first, to love God with all our heart, soul, and mind." — [Two Great Commandments, October 2019](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2019/10/35oaks.md)

> "Walk a fine line between law and love—keeping the commandments and walking the covenant path, while loving our neighbors along the way." — [Two Great Commandments, October 2019](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2019/10/35oaks.md)

### 3. Repent — Now, Not Later

> "True repentance is not an event. It is a never-ending privilege. It is *fundamental* to progression and having peace of mind, comfort, and joy." — [Cleansed by Repentance, April 2019](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2019/04/51oaks.md)

> "We must not 'procrastinate the day of our repentance' until death." — [Cleansed by Repentance, April 2019](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2019/04/51oaks.md) (Alma 34:33–34)

### 4. Ask "Where Will This Lead?"

President Oaks's signature question — a filter for every decision:

> "As we make current decisions, we should always be asking, **'Where will this lead?'**" — [Where Will This Lead?, April 2019](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2019/04/35oaks.md)

> "Begin with the end in mind. For us, the end is always on the covenant path through the temple to eternal life." — [Where Will This Lead?, April 2019](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2019/04/35oaks.md)

### 5. Love Your Enemies — Be a Peacemaker

> "Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you." — [Love Your Enemies, October 2020](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2020/10/17oaks.md) (Matthew 5:43–44)

> "We must forgo the anger and hatred with which political choices are debated or denounced." — [Love Your Enemies, October 2020](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2020/10/17oaks.md)

> "Contention is a choice. Peacemaking is a choice. You have your agency to choose." — [Following Christ, October 2024](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2024/10/18oaks.md)

### 6. Use the Four Divine Helps

In his April 2025 address — his first as President of the Church — President Oaks laid out the four divine helps God has provided for mortality:

1. **The Light of Christ** — given to every person born
2. **The scriptures, commandments, ordinances, and covenants**
3. **Manifestations of the Holy Ghost** — available to all who seek truth
4. **The gift of the Holy Ghost** — for those who have been baptized and confirmed

> "Trust in God and seek and use these divine helps, most notably the Atonement of His Beloved Son." — [Divine Helps for Mortality, April 2025](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/04/47oaks.md)

### 7. Make and Keep Covenants — Including Wearing the Garment

> "Covenants do not 'take a day off.'" — [Covenants and Responsibilities, April 2024](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2024/04/47oaks.md)

> To remove garments "can be understood as a disclaimer of the covenant responsibilities and blessings to which they relate." — [Covenants and Responsibilities, April 2024](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2024/04/47oaks.md)

### 8. Attend Church — Don't Give Up on Gathering

> "I go to church each week with the intent of being **active, not passive**, and making a positive difference in people's lives." — [The Need for a Church, October 2021](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2021/10/18oaks.md)

> "Personal disappointments should never keep us from the doctrine of Christ, who taught us to serve, not to be served." — [The Need for a Church, October 2021](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2021/10/18oaks.md)

### 9. Strengthen Families — The Center of Everything

> "Parents and grandparents must be the master teachers. Their most effective teaching is by example." — [The Family-Centered Gospel of Jesus Christ, October 2025](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/10/58oaks.md)

> "Pray together as families: kneeling night and morning to offer thanks for blessings and to pray over common concerns." — [The Family-Centered Gospel, October 2025](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/10/58oaks.md)

> "What those children really want for dinner is **time with you.**" — [The Family-Centered Gospel, October 2025](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/10/58oaks.md)

### 10. Be Converted, Not Just Convinced

> "It is not even enough to be *convinced* of the gospel; we must act so that we are *converted* by it." — [Kingdoms of Glory, October 2023](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2023/10/17oaks.md)

> "It is not enough for anyone just to go through the motions. The commandments, ordinances, and covenants of the gospel are not a list of deposits required to be made in some heavenly account." — [Kingdoms of Glory, October 2023](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2023/10/17oaks.md)

---

## III. The Promised Blessings

### Every Child of God Receives a Kingdom of Glory

President Oaks repeatedly teaches that God's love is *so* vast that nearly all His children inherit glory:

> "**All the children of God will finally wind up in a kingdom of glory.**" — [Divine Love in the Father's Plan, April 2022](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2022/04/51oaks.md)

> "God's love is so great that, except for the few who deliberately become sons of perdition, He has provided a **destiny of glory** for all of His children." — [The Great Plan, April 2020](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2020/04/51oaks.md)

> Christ "glorifies the Father, and **saves all the works of his hands.**" — [Kingdoms of Glory, October 2023](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2023/10/17oaks.md) (D&C 76:43)

### Forgiveness and Cleansing

> "The most serious sins can be forgiven in mortality because of our Savior's atoning sacrifice." — [Cleansed by Repentance, April 2019](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2019/04/51oaks.md)

> "When we repent, we have the Lord's assurance that our sins, including our acts and desires, will be cleansed and our merciful final judge will 'remember them no more.'" — [Cleansed by Repentance, April 2019](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2019/04/51oaks.md) (D&C 58:42)

### Strength to Endure

> "Fear thou not; for I am with thee: … I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee." — [What Has Our Savior Done for Us?, April 2021](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2021/04/35oaks.md) (Isaiah 41:10)

> "It was intended that life be a challenge, **not so that you would fail, but that you might succeed through overcoming.**" — [Be of Good Cheer, October 2020](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2020/10/36oaks.md)

### The Lord Fights Our Battles

> "Be of good cheer; I have overcome the world." — [Be of Good Cheer, October 2020](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2020/10/36oaks.md) (John 16:33)

> "Thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment; and then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes." — [Be of Good Cheer, October 2020](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2020/10/36oaks.md) (D&C 121:7–8)

> "Be of good cheer, for I will lead you along. The kingdom is yours and the blessings thereof are yours, and the riches of eternity are yours." — [Be of Good Cheer, October 2020](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2020/10/36oaks.md) (D&C 78:18)

### Eternal Family

> "Temple ordinances enable us to return as eternal families to the presence of our Heavenly Father." — [The Family-Centered Gospel, October 2025](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/10/58oaks.md)

> "Heavenly Father's plan assures this possibility for everyone." — [The Family-Centered Gospel, October 2025](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/10/58oaks.md)

### The Covenant Path Opens Every Spiritual Blessing

> "Keep on the covenant path. Your commitment to follow the Savior by making covenants with Him and then keeping those covenants will **open the door to every spiritual blessing and privilege** available to men, women, and children everywhere." — [Truth and the Plan, October 2018](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2018/10/truth-and-the-plan.md)

### The Holy Ghost as Daily Companion

> The Holy Ghost fills the faithful "day by day with joy and gladness, with a disposition to do good to all men, to suffer wrong rather than to do wrong, to be kind and merciful, long suffering and charitable." — [Divine Helps for Mortality, April 2025](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/04/47oaks.md) (Joseph F. Smith)

His consistent message: understand the plan, choose the celestial, and let the Atonement do its work.
