# Noah and Our Living Prophets: The Pattern That Never Changes

*Come Follow Me Supplement — Genesis 6–11; Moses 8 — "Noah Found Grace in the Eyes of the Lord"*

> "How is our living prophet like Noah? Of course, the Lord's prophet today isn't warning of a Flood or inviting us to help build an ark. But what is he warning us about? And what is he inviting us to do?" — *Come, Follow Me* Manual

---

## The Pattern

The scriptures show us the same prophetic pattern repeating across every dispensation. A prophet is called. He warns. He invites. He promises blessings. Most people reject the message. Those who hearken are preserved. Noah embodied this pattern perfectly — and our living prophets embody it now.

---

## I. The Prophet's Call

### Noah

> "And the Lord ordained Noah after his own order, and commanded him that he should go forth and **declare his Gospel** unto the children of men, even as it was given unto Enoch." — [Moses 8:19](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/8.md)

Noah didn't invent a new message. He preached "the things of God, even as it was in the beginning" ([Moses 8:16](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/8.md)). The gospel he taught was the *same* gospel — the eternal gospel of Jesus Christ.

### President Nelson (2018–2025)

From his first conference, President Nelson spoke with the clarity of a man who knew his prophetic charge:

> "I know that the Lord will bless you as you look to Him for guidance and direction in your life." — Introductory Remarks, April 2018

Over seven years and 44 conference addresses, his message was unwavering: this is Christ's Church, the adversary is escalating, time is short, and the only refuge is the covenant path — exactly what Noah taught.

### President Oaks (2018–present)

As First Counselor and now President of the Church, President Oaks has consistently built the *doctrinal framework* undergirding the prophetic warnings — the plan of salvation, the kingdoms of glory, the divine nature of family, the mechanisms of spiritual decline:

> "We who know God's plan and who have covenanted to participate have a clear responsibility to teach these truths and do all that we can to further them." — [The Great Plan, April 2020](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2020/04/51oaks.md)

---

## II. The Warnings — Then and Now

| Noah's Day | Our Day — Nelson & Oaks |
|------------|-------------------------|
| "The wickedness of men had become great in the earth; and every man was lifted up in the imagination of the thoughts of his heart, being only evil continually" ([Moses 8:22](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/8.md)) | "During these perilous times … **Satan is no longer even *trying* to hide his attacks on God's plan.** Emboldened evil abounds." — Nelson, [Let God Prevail, Oct 2020](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2020/10/46nelson.md) |
| "They will not hearken to my voice" ([Moses 8:15](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/8.md)) | "**In coming days, it will not be possible to survive spiritually** without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost." — Nelson, [Revelation for the Church, April 2018](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2018/04/revelation-for-the-church-revelation-for-our-lives.md) |
| "The daughters of thy sons have sold themselves" ([Moses 8:15](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/8.md)) | Satan "seeks to **confuse gender**, to **distort marriage**, and to **discourage childbearing**." — Oaks, [Truth and the Plan, Oct 2018](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2018/10/truth-and-the-plan.md) |
| Giants "sought Noah to take away his life" ([Moses 8:18](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/8.md)) | "The adversary is increasing his attacks on faith and upon us and our families at an **exponential rate**." — Nelson, [Opening Remarks, Oct 2018](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2018/10/opening-remarks.md) |
| "My Spirit shall not always strive with man" ([Moses 8:17](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/8.md)) | "**Time is running out.** … Do the spiritual work to find out for yourselves, and **please do it now.**" — Nelson, ["Come, Follow Me", April 2019](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2019/04/46nelson.md) |
| "The earth was corrupt before God, and it was filled with violence" ([Moses 8:28](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/8.md)) | "The present hostility in public dialogue and on social media is alarming. **Hateful words are deadly weapons.**" — Nelson, [Confidence in the Presence of God, April 2025](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/04/57nelson.md) |
| "All flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth" ([Moses 8:29](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/8.md)) | "We are surrounded by media influences and cultural deteriorations that will carry us downstream in our values **if we are not continually resisting.**" — Oaks, [Small and Simple Things, April 2018](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2018/04/small-and-simple-things.md) |

The parallels are striking. Noah faced a world where people had "corrupted its way." Our prophets face a world where truth itself is under assault, families are deteriorating, and the adversary isn't even bothering to hide anymore.

---

## III. The Invitations — Then and Now

### Noah's Invitation

Noah's invitation was the gospel itself — unchanged across all dispensations:

> "**Believe and repent of your sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, even as our fathers**, and ye shall receive the Holy Ghost, that ye may have all things made manifest; and if ye do not this, the floods will come in upon you." — [Moses 8:24](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/8.md)

Four elements: **believe**, **repent**, **be baptized**, **receive the Holy Ghost**. Note also: "even as our fathers" — this wasn't new. It was the same gospel Adam, Enoch, and Methuselah taught.

### Our Prophets' Invitations — The Same Gospel, Applied Today

| Noah's Invitation | Nelson's Application | Oaks's Application |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Believe** | "Choose to believe and stay faithful. … Stop increasing your doubts by rehearsing them with other doubters." — [Christ Is Risen, Apr 2021](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2021/04/49nelson.md) | "Exercise faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, which is the first principle of the gospel." — [Truth and the Plan, Oct 2018](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2018/10/truth-and-the-plan.md) |
| **Repent** | "I plead with you to repent. Experience the strengthening power of **daily repentance** — of doing and being a little better each day." — [We Can Do Better, Apr 2019](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2019/04/36nelson.md) | "True repentance is not an event. It is a **never-ending privilege**." — [Cleansed by Repentance, Apr 2019](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2019/04/51oaks.md) |
| **Be baptized** (covenant) | "Get on the covenant path and stay there. The covenant path is the *only* path that leads to exaltation and eternal life." — [Spiritual Momentum, Apr 2022](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2022/04/47nelson.md) | "Keep on the covenant path. Your commitment … will open the door to **every spiritual blessing.**" — [Truth and the Plan, Oct 2018](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2018/10/truth-and-the-plan.md) |
| **Receive the Holy Ghost** | "Stretch beyond your current spiritual ability to receive **personal revelation.**" — [Revelation for the Church, Apr 2018](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2018/04/revelation-for-the-church-revelation-for-our-lives.md) | Use the four divine helps, especially "the gift of the Holy Ghost." — [Divine Helps for Mortality, Apr 2025](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/04/47oaks.md) |

But our prophets have *extended* and *applied* these same principles with remarkable specificity:

- **Temple worship** — Nelson: "Nothing will help you *more* to hold fast to the iron rod. … Nothing will protect you *more*. … Nothing!" — [Rejoice in the Gift of Priesthood Keys, Apr 2024](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2024/04/57nelson.md)
- **Think celestial** — Nelson: "Your choices today will determine three things: where you will live throughout all eternity, the kind of body with which you will be resurrected, and those with whom you will live forever." — [Think Celestial!, Oct 2023](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2023/10/51nelson.md)
- **Let God prevail** — Nelson: "Are you *willing* to have your will swallowed up in His?" — [Let God Prevail, Oct 2020](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2020/10/46nelson.md)
- **Ask "Where will this lead?"** — Oaks: "Begin with the end in mind. For us, the end is always on the covenant path through the temple to eternal life." — [Where Will This Lead?, Apr 2019](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2019/04/35oaks.md)
- **Strengthen families** — Oaks: "What those children really want for dinner is time with you." — [The Family-Centered Gospel, Oct 2025](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/10/58oaks.md)
- **Be a peacemaker** — Nelson: "Now is the time to bury your weapons of war." — [Peacemakers Needed, Apr 2023](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson.md)

---

## IV. The Promised Blessings — Then and Now

### Noah's Promise

> "Ye shall receive the Holy Ghost, that ye may have **all things made manifest.**" — [Moses 8:24](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/8.md)

This is no small promise. "All things made manifest" — revelation, knowledge, discernment, protection, guidance. Everything needed to navigate the flood, spiritual or literal.

### Our Prophets' Promises — Extending Noah's

| Blessing Category | Nelson | Oaks |
|-------------------|--------|------|
| **Revelation** | "The heavens will open for you. … Increased inspiration and revelation." — [Sisters' Participation, Oct 2018](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2018/10/sisters-participation-in-the-gathering-of-israel.md) | "The truths of eternity shall be opened unto you." — [Melchizedek Priesthood, Apr 2020](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2020/04/36oaks.md) |
| **Protection** | "Decreased fear and increased faith will follow." — [Go Forward in Faith, Apr 2020](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2020/04/57nelson.md) | "If ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail." — [Be of Good Cheer, Oct 2020](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2020/10/36oaks.md) (D&C 6:34) |
| **Miracles** | "The Lord will bring the miracles He knows you need." — [Becoming Exemplary, Oct 2018](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2018/10/becoming-exemplary-latter-day-saints.md) | "Vested in the power of the priesthood … is the power to perform miracles." — [The Powers of the Priesthood, Apr 2018](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2018/04/the-powers-of-the-priesthood.md) |
| **Peace** | "Greater peace, confidence, joy, and yes, *rest*." — [Overcome the World, Oct 2022](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2022/10/47nelson.md) | "Be of good cheer, for I will lead you along." — [Be of Good Cheer, Oct 2020](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2020/10/36oaks.md) (D&C 78:18) |
| **Forgiveness** | "Repentance … is the key to happiness and peace of mind." — [We Can Do Better, Apr 2019](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2019/04/36nelson.md) | "Even the most serious sins can be forgiven in mortality." — [Cleansed by Repentance, Apr 2019](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2019/04/51oaks.md) |
| **Power of God** | "Spiritual power that exceeds our greatest hopes." — [Confidence in the Presence of God, Apr 2025](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/04/57nelson.md) | The covenant path "will open the door to every spiritual blessing." — [Truth and the Plan, Oct 2018](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2018/10/truth-and-the-plan.md) |
| **Eternal family** | "Your afflictions will be swallowed up in the joy of Christ." — [The Lord Will Come Again, Oct 2024](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2024/10/57nelson.md) | "Temple ordinances enable us to return as eternal families." — [Family-Centered Gospel, Oct 2025](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/10/58oaks.md) |

---

## V. The Response — Then and Now

This is the point that should make us tremble.

### Noah's Generation

> "They hearkened **not** unto his words." — [Moses 8:20](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/8.md)

> "They came up before him, saying: **Behold, we are the sons of God; have we not taken unto ourselves the daughters of men? And are we not eating and drinking, and marrying and giving in marriage?** And our wives bear unto us children, and the same are mighty men." — [Moses 8:21](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/8.md)

Their response was not atheism — it was self-satisfied religion. "We are the sons of God!" they said. They claimed covenant status while ignoring the covenant requirements. They were comfortable, prosperous, and busy with the routines of life. They didn't reject God outright — they just didn't think they needed to change.

### Our Generation?

Consider how this mirrors President Oaks's warning:

> "It is not enough for anyone just to **go through the motions.** The commandments, ordinances, and covenants of the gospel are not a list of deposits required to be made in some heavenly account." — [Kingdoms of Glory, October 2023](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2023/10/17oaks.md)

> "Of those invited to meet Him, **only half will be prepared.**" — [Divine Helps for Mortality, April 2025](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/04/47oaks.md)

And President Nelson's:

> "**Lazy learners and lax disciples** will always struggle to muster even a particle of faith." — [Christ Is Risen, April 2021](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2021/04/49nelson.md)

> "I grieve for those who leave the Church because they feel membership requires too much of them. **They have not yet discovered that making and keeping covenants actually makes life easier!**" — [Overcome the World, October 2022](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2022/10/47nelson.md)

The people of Noah's day thought they were fine. Are we sure *we're* not making the same mistake?

---

## VI. The Ark — What Is It Today?

Noah built a physical ark. What is the ark today?

President Nelson has answered this question explicitly across his ministry. The ark is not a single thing — it is a *way of living*:

| Component of the Ark | Source |
|----------------------|--------|
| **The temple** | "Nothing will help you *more* to hold fast to the iron rod. … Nothing!" — Nelson, [Priesthood Keys, Apr 2024](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2024/04/57nelson.md) |
| **Personal revelation** | "It will not be possible to survive spiritually without … the Holy Ghost." — Nelson, [Revelation, Apr 2018](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2018/04/revelation-for-the-church-revelation-for-our-lives.md) |
| **The home as sanctuary** | "Make your home your *primary* sanctuary of faith and *be not moved.*" — Nelson, [What We Are Learning, Apr 2021](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2021/04/36nelson.md) |
| **Covenants** | "Whenever any kind of upheaval occurs in your life, the safest place to be *spiritually* is living *inside* your temple covenants!" — Nelson, [Temple and Spiritual Foundation, Oct 2021](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2021/10/47nelson.md) |
| **Daily repentance** | "Daily repentance is the pathway to purity, and purity brings power." — Nelson, [We Can Do Better, Apr 2019](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2019/04/36nelson.md) |
| **The Church itself** | "If we cease valuing our churches for any reason, we threaten our personal spiritual life." — Oaks, [Need for a Church, Oct 2021](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2021/10/18oaks.md) |
| **Family** | "Parents and grandparents must be the master teachers." — Oaks, [Family-Centered Gospel, Oct 2025](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/10/58oaks.md) |
| **The scriptures** | "The Book of Mormon *is* our *latter-day* survival guide." — Nelson, [Embrace the Future with Faith, Oct 2020](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2020/10/37nelson.md) |

Noah's ark was a refuge from physical destruction. Our ark — built from covenants, temples, revelation, repentance, family, and faith — is a refuge from spiritual destruction. The flood this time is not water. It is deception, distraction, contention, and despair. And the invitation to board the ark is just as urgent.

---

## VII. Application — What Will *We* Do?

The *Come, Follow Me* manual asks: "How is our living prophet like Noah?"

The answer is: **In every way that matters.**

- Noah was ordained by God and sent to warn. So are our prophets.
- Noah preached the same gospel as his fathers. So do our prophets.
- Noah's generation thought they were fine without changing. So does much of ours.
- Noah's warnings were specific and came with specific invited actions. So do ours.
- Noah's promises were magnificent for those who hearkened. So are ours.
- Noah's generation ran out of time. Ours will too.

The question is not *whether* we believe there is a prophet. The question is whether we will be among those who *hearken* — or among those who say, "Behold, we are the sons of God; are we not eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage?" ([Moses 8:21](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/8.md)).

### Personal Application Questions

1. **Which of President Nelson's invitations have I fully accepted?** Which am I still setting aside?
2. **Am I inside the ark?** Am I making regular appointments with the Lord in His temple? Am I seeking personal revelation daily? Am I repenting daily?
3. **Am I like Noah's generation?** Am I comfortable, busy, and claiming covenant status while not actually changing? Am I "going through the motions"?
4. **Where will this lead?** (President Oaks's question.) If I continue on my current trajectory, will I be among the five wise virgins or the five foolish?
5. **What is *my* flood?** What specific deception, distraction, or spiritual danger is the adversary using against *me* right now? What have the prophets said about it?
6. **Am I a peacemaker in my home?** In my ward? In my community? Or am I contributing to the "violence" and contention that filled Noah's earth?

---

## VIII. A Final Witness

Noah found grace because he "was a just man, and perfect in his generation; and **he walked with God**" ([Moses 8:27](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/8.md)).

President Nelson's closing invitation — the last major address of his prophetic ministry — echoed the same aspiration:

> "Let thy bowels … be full of charity towards all men, … and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; ***then* shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God.**" — [Confidence in the Presence of God, April 2025](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/04/57nelson.md) (D&C 121:45)

Noah walked with God. Our prophet invites us to have *confidence* in the presence of God. The invitation is the same. The flood is different, but the ark is the same — Jesus Christ and His covenant path.

> "**The best is yet to come … because the Savior is coming again!**" — Nelson, [The Lord Jesus Christ Will Come Again, October 2024](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2024/10/57nelson.md)
