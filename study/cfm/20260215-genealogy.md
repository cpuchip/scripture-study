# Why the Begats Matter

## Observation

Listening to Genesis 6–11 and Moses 8, what stands out is how much genealogy there is. Genesis 5 is entirely a genealogy. Genesis 10 is entirely a genealogy. Genesis 11:10–32 is a genealogy. Moses 6:1–23 and Moses 8:1–12 repeat and expand these genealogies with additional detail. It seemed important enough for God to include it in both the Pearl of Great Price *and* throughout Genesis.

So the question is: What can be gained from all the begats?

The answer turns out to be far more than you'd expect. These genealogies carry at least five layers of meaning — and the most important one was taught by Joseph Smith in the Lectures on Faith.

---

## I. The Chain of Knowledge — Lectures on Faith, Lecture 2

This is the most powerful insight.

In [Lecture 2](../../books/lecture-on-faith/02_lecture_2.md), Joseph Smith asks a deceptively simple question: *How did men first come to know that God exists?* The answer: God revealed Himself to Adam, and Adam told his children. From that point forward, the knowledge of God passed from father to son — not by new revelation each time, but by the **testimony of fathers**.

Then comes the key move. Joseph takes the "begats" of [Genesis 5](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/5.md) — the ages at which each patriarch was born and died — and calculates the **overlapping lifespans**.

The result is stunning:

> "So that Lamech, the father of Noah; Methuselah, Enoch, Jared, Mahalaleel, Cainan, Enos, Seth, and Adam, were all living at the same time, and beyond all controversy, were all preachers of righteousness."
> — [Lectures on Faith 2:39](../../books/lecture-on-faith/02_lecture_2.md)

**Nine patriarchs** — from Adam to Lamech — were alive simultaneously. Adam lived 930 years. Seth was born when Adam was 130, and Seth lived to 912. Their lifetimes overlapped by 800 years. Following this chain:

- **Lamech** (Noah's father) was 56 years old when Adam died
- **Methuselah** was 243 when Adam died
- **Noah** was 84 when Enos died, 366 when Jared died, 600 when Methuselah died

Adam could have personally taught Methuselah, and Methuselah personally taught Noah. That is a **two-person chain** covering the entire pre-flood world — roughly 1,656 years — with no gap, no break, no loss of testimony from one generation to the next.

Then Joseph does it again with [Genesis 11](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/11.md), the post-flood genealogy from Noah to Abraham:

> "It appears from this account, that Nahor, Abraham's brother, Terah, Nahor, Serug, Reu, Peleg, Eber, Salah, Arphaxed, Shem, and Noah, all lived on the earth at the same time."
> — [Lectures on Faith 2:52](../../books/lecture-on-faith/02_lecture_2.md)

Noah died only 2 years before Abraham was born (using one chronology). Shem — Noah's son who was *on the ark* — was still alive when Abraham was 150 years old. The witness of the Flood was not ancient history to Abraham. It was living memory.

Joseph's conclusion:

> "From the foregoing it is easily to be seen, not only how the knowledge of God came into the world, but upon what principle it was preserved: that from the time it was first communicated, it was retained in the minds of righteous men, who taught, not only their own posterity, but the world; so that there was no need of a new revelation to man, after Adam's creation, to Noah, to give them the first idea, or notion of the existence of a God."
> — [Lectures on Faith 2:44](../../books/lecture-on-faith/02_lecture_2.md)

**The "begats" are the proof.** Without the ages and lifespans, you can't demonstrate the overlapping chain. Without the chain, you can't prove that knowledge of God was preserved by continuous living testimony. The genealogies aren't filler — they're the *evidence* that faith was never left without a witness.

### The Connection to Moses 6:22–23

The Pearl of Great Price confirms this explicitly:

> "And this is the genealogy of the sons of Adam, who was the son of God, with whom God, himself, conversed. And they were **preachers of righteousness**, and spake and prophesied, and called upon all men, everywhere, to repent; and **faith was taught** unto the children of men."
> — [Moses 6:22–23](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)

The genealogy isn't just a family tree. It's a list of **preachers**. Each name represents a living witness who taught faith in God to the next generation. When Moses 6 says "and they were preachers of righteousness," it's attaching that statement directly to the genealogy itself — as if to say, *this is what the begats mean*.

---

## II. The Book of Remembrance — Why Records Matter

The genealogies are also connected to the first **scripture** ever written:

> "And a **book of remembrance** was kept, in the which was recorded, in the language of Adam, for it was given unto as many as called upon God to write by the **spirit of inspiration**."
> — [Moses 6:5](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)

And two verses later:

> "Now this same **Priesthood**, which was in the beginning, shall be in the end of the world also. Now this prophecy Adam spake, as he was moved upon by the Holy Ghost, and a **genealogy was kept** of the children of God. And this was the **book of the generations of Adam**."
> — [Moses 6:7–8](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)

Notice how Moses 6 weaves three things together:
1. **A book of remembrance** — written by the spirit of inspiration
2. **A genealogy of the children of God** — tracking the covenant line
3. **The Priesthood** — which "was in the beginning" and "shall be in the end of the world also"

The genealogy, the scripture, and the priesthood are inseparable. The act of keeping a record of "the children of God" is itself a priesthood function, done by the spirit of inspiration, and constitutes the first scripture.

President Spencer W. Kimball taught: "Adam received the priesthood and kept his genealogies in a book of remembrance" ([April 1974 General Conference](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/1974/04/what-do-we-hear.md)). The General Handbook of the Church cites Moses 6:5 as the scriptural precedent for all Church record-keeping ([General Handbook, 33](../../gospel-library/eng/manual/general-handbook/33-records-and-reports.md)).

---

## III. Priesthood Lineage — Tracking Authority

The footnote on [Genesis 5:1](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/5.md) — "This is the book of the generations of Adam" — points to **TG Priesthood, History of**. The Church's own cross-referencing system tells us that the "book of the generations" is a **priesthood history**.

This is confirmed by modern revelation. [D&C 107:40–57](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.md) takes the same genealogical line — Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech, Noah — and reveals what the Genesis genealogy *doesn't explicitly say*: each of these men was **ordained** to the priesthood, and the ordination ages are given:

- Seth: ordained at 69 by Adam ([D&C 107:42](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.md))
- Enos: ordained at 134 by Adam ([v. 44](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.md))
- Cainan: ordained at 87 by Adam ([v. 45](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.md))
- Enoch: ordained at 25 by Adam ([v. 48](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.md))
- Methuselah: ordained at 100 by Adam ([v. 50](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.md))
- Lamech: ordained at 32 by Seth ([v. 51](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.md))
- Noah: ordained at 10 by Methuselah ([v. 52](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.md))

Adam personally ordained **six** of these men. He wasn't just the first father — he was the presiding high priest who conferred authority down through his lineage. The "begats" track this chain of authority.

[D&C 84:6–17](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.md) extends the chain in the other direction, from Moses back through Abraham, Melchizedek, and Noah to Adam:

> "Which Abraham received the priesthood from Melchizedek, who received it through the lineage of his fathers, even till Noah; And from Noah till Enoch, through the lineage of their fathers; And from Enoch to Abel, who was slain by the conspiracy of his brother, who received the priesthood by the commandments of God, by the hand of his father Adam, who was the first man — Which priesthood continueth in the church of God in all generations."
> — [D&C 84:14–17](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.md)

The genealogy is the priesthood's **chain of custody**.

### Abraham Sought These Records

Abraham himself understood this. In the opening of his record, he explains why lineage mattered to him:

> "I sought for the blessings of the fathers, and the right whereunto I should be ordained to administer the same… It was conferred upon me from the fathers; it came down from the fathers, from the beginning of time, yea, even from the beginning, or before the foundation of the earth, down to the present time, even the right of the firstborn, or the first man, who is Adam, or first father, through the fathers unto me."
> — [Abraham 1:2–3](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/1.md)

And later:

> "But the records of the fathers, even the patriarchs, concerning the right of Priesthood, the Lord my God preserved in mine own hands."
> — [Abraham 1:31](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/1.md)

Abraham was in a world where his own father had turned to idolatry ([Abraham 1:5](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/1.md)). The genealogical records — "the records of the fathers" — were his evidence that priesthood authority existed, that it was passed through a specific line, and that *he had a legitimate claim to it*. Without the genealogy, Abraham would have had no grounds to seek ordination.

---

## IV. Covenant Lineage to Christ

The Old Testament genealogies are the *beginning* of a chain that terminates at Christ.

[Matthew 1:1](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/matt/1.md) opens with: "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham." Matthew then traces Christ's lineage from Abraham forward — through Judah, David, Solomon, and the kings — in three groups of fourteen generations.

[Luke 3:23–38](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/luke/3.md) goes the other direction, tracing Christ's lineage *backward* all the way to "Adam, which was the son of God." Luke's genealogy passes through the exact names we find in Genesis 5 and 11: Lamech, Methuselah, Enoch, Jared, Mahalaleel, Cainan, Enos, Seth, Adam.

The Genesis begats aren't an isolated list. They are the **first links** in the chain that connects Adam to Jesus Christ. When you read "Jared begat Enoch, and Enoch begat Methuselah," you are reading the covenant line that leads, generation by generation, to the Savior of the world.

### The Genealogy's Final Statement

Luke 3:38 ends with: "…which was the son of Adam, **which was the son of God**."

Moses 6:22 says the same thing: "And this is the genealogy of the sons of Adam, **who was the son of God**, with whom God, himself, conversed."

The genealogy begins with God and terminates at Christ. Every name between is a link.

---

## V. The Lifespan Pattern — Something Changed

The genealogies also record a measurable change in the human condition.

**Pre-flood lifespans** (Genesis 5):
| Name | Age at Death |
|------|-------------|
| Adam | 930 |
| Seth | 912 |
| Enos | 905 |
| Cainan | 910 |
| Mahalaleel | 895 |
| Jared | 962 |
| Enoch | 365 (translated) |
| Methuselah | 969 |
| Lamech | 777 |
| Noah | 950 |

**Post-flood lifespans** (Genesis 11):
| Name | Age at Death |
|------|-------------|
| Shem | 600 |
| Arphaxad | 438 |
| Salah | 433 |
| Eber | 464 |
| Peleg | 239 |
| Reu | 239 |
| Serug | 230 |
| Nahor | 148 |
| Terah | 205 |
| Abraham | 175 |

Pre-flood, lifespans cluster around 900 years. Post-flood, they drop by nearly half in the first generation (Shem: 600), then halve again within a few generations (Peleg: 239), and continue declining until Abraham's lifetime of 175 years — and by Moses's day, the span is 120 years ([Moses 8:17](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/8.md); [Psalm 90:10](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/ps/90.md)).

The genealogies are the only biblical source for this data. Without them, we'd have no record of the dramatic change in human lifespan after the Flood.

---

## VI. Naming as Prophecy

Hebrew names carry meaning, and several names in the genealogies are explicitly prophetic:

- **Noah** — Hebrew: *rest, comfort*. His father Lamech named him saying, "This same shall **comfort** us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the Lord hath cursed" ([Genesis 5:29](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/5.md); [Moses 8:9](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/8.md)). Noah's name is a prophecy that through him, the curse on the ground would begin to be resolved.

- **Peleg** — Hebrew: *division*. "For in his days was the earth divided" ([Genesis 10:25](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/10.md)). His name marks a world-changing event.

- **Adam** — The footnote on [Genesis 5:2](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/5.md) notes: "In Hebrew *adam* is also a common noun, meaning man, or mankind." The name of the first man is the name of all humanity.

- **Seth** — Hebrew: *appointed, established*. Eve named him saying "God hath appointed me another seed, instead of Abel, whom Cain slew" ([Moses 6:2](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)). He is the replacement — the covenant line reestablished after Abel's murder.

When read with their meanings, the genealogies become narratives of prophecy and providence.

---

## VII. The Table of Nations — One Family

[Genesis 10](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/10.md) — the "Table of Nations" — is a genealogy of a different kind. Rather than tracking a covenant line, it maps the **spread of all human civilization** from Noah's three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

- **Japheth's** sons become the "isles of the Gentiles" ([v. 5](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/10.md)) — Europe, Asia Minor, the Mediterranean
- **Ham's** sons include Cush (Ethiopia), Mizraim (Egypt), and Canaan — and notably **Nimrod**, whose kingdom began with **Babel** ([v. 10](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/10.md))
- **Shem's** line carries through Eber (from whom the name "Hebrew" may derive) to Abraham

The theological point of Genesis 10 is that every nation on earth traces back to one family, and ultimately to one God. In an ancient world full of competing tribal deities, this is a radical claim: there is no nation that does not descend from Noah, and no people who fall outside the scope of God's covenant purposes.

The chapter ends: "These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the **nations divided** in the earth after the flood" ([Genesis 10:32](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/10.md)).

---

## VIII. The Assembly at Adam-ondi-Ahman

D&C 107 doesn't just trace priesthood ordinations — it describes a **gathering** of the patriarchs:

> "Three years previous to the death of Adam, he called Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, and Methuselah, who were all high priests, with the residue of his posterity who were righteous, into the valley of **Adam-ondi-Ahman**, and there bestowed upon them his last blessing. And the **Lord appeared** unto them, and they rose up and blessed Adam, and called him Michael, the prince, the archangel."
> — [D&C 107:53–54](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.md)

Every name on the Genesis 5 genealogy (except Lamech and Noah, who weren't yet born) was present at this gathering. They were all alive at the same time, all high priests, and the Lord Himself appeared to them.

Adam then "predicted whatsoever should befall his posterity unto the latest generation" ([v. 56](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.md)). And all of it "was written in the book of Enoch, and are to be testified of in due time" ([v. 57](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.md)).

The genealogy of Genesis 5 is, in effect, the **attendance roster** for Adam-ondi-Ahman.
