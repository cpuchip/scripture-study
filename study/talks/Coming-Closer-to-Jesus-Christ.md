## Why This Talk Matters

This is President Oaks' **first address as prophet** — delivered at BYU on February 10, 2026, just four months after being set apart as president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (October 14, 2025). A prophet's first major address signals what the Lord is placing on his heart. And what President Oaks chose to teach has a *remarkable* number of intersections with the framework we've been building in [truth.md](../truth.md) — the mechanics of existence, the nature of truth and light, the relationship between scientific and spiritual knowledge, and the role of humility and comprehension.

The talk is deceptively simple — four practical points for "coming closer to Jesus Christ." But underneath that simplicity is a doctrinal infrastructure that maps directly onto the deepest scriptural principles we've been studying. This study traces those connections.

---

## Talk Structure

President Oaks organizes around **four impressions** for drawing closer to the Savior:

1. **Strengthen our faith in Him** — anchored in the first article of faith
2. **Increase our humility** — "teachableness," the master virtue
3. **Seek help from others** — surround yourself with believers
4. **Be patient** — trust His timing, busy yourself with service

Each of these is a practical application of deep doctrinal mechanics. Let's trace the connections.

## Part 1: The Two Methods of Knowledge — Where Oaks Meets D&C 93

### The Core Statement

The most doctrinally significant passage in the talk comes within the humility section. President Oaks says:

> "We are grateful to know that there are two methods of gaining needed knowledge: (1) the evolving disclosures of man discovered by the scientific method and (2) the truths disclosed by the spiritual method, which begins with faith in God and relies on scriptures, inspired teaching, and personal revelation. There is no ultimate conflict between knowledge gained by these different methods because God, our omnipotent Eternal Father, knows all truth and beckons us to learn by both methods."

This is the prophetic version of what we mapped scripturally in [truth.md Part 4](../truth.md):

> **"The Scientific Method Is a Form of Revelation"** — To discover truth (conformity to reality, things as they are) through careful observation and testing is to do what the Gods do: comprehend the light. Science, properly conducted, is the exercise of intelligence comprehending truth in a particular sphere. It is inherently spiritual work, even when the practitioner doesn't recognize it as such.

President Oaks frames it from the practical side. Our truth study frames it from the ontological side. They arrive at the same place: **there is no ultimate conflict** because both methods discover truth — and truth "was not created or made, neither indeed can be" ([D&C 93:29](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)).

### The Evans Quote — "Simply Man's Discovering"

President Oaks then quotes Elder Richard L. Evans:

> "Science after all (even when it is true and final and factual) is simply man's discovering of a few things that God already knows and controls in his ordering of the universe. . . . God has not told us all he knows. We believe in continuous revelation. Be patient. Keep humble and balanced in all things."

This is the practical expression of the eternal-truth framework. Consider the parallels:

| Evans / Oaks (2026) | Truth Study (D&C 93) |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| "Science is simply man's *discovering*" | Truth "was not created or made, neither indeed can be" — it is *discovered* ([D&C 93:29](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)) |
| "A few things that *God already knows*" | God "comprehended all things" ([D&C 88:6](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md)); truth = "knowledge of things as they are" ([D&C 93:24](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)) |
| "God has not told us all he knows" | "Man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend" ([Mosiah 4:9](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.md)) |
| "We believe in continuous revelation" | "He that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is glorified in truth and knoweth all things" ([D&C 93:28](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)) — grace for grace, continuous |
| "Be patient. Keep humble." | President Oaks' points 2 and 4 — humility and patience |

The Evans quote is D&C 93 in plain language. And President Oaks chose it for his first address as prophet. That's not coincidence — it's emphasis.

### "Never Let Your Secular Learning Limit Your Horizons"

This sentence from President Oaks is a direct application of [D&C 29:34](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.md): "All things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal."

The error isn't *having* secular learning. The error is treating the sphere of secular knowledge as the *whole* of reality. Our truth study mapped this: truth is "independent in that sphere in which God has placed it" ([D&C 93:30](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)). Scientific truth operates in its sphere. Spiritual truth operates in a broader sphere that *encompasses* the scientific. To mistake the part for the whole is to "live without God in the world" ([Mosiah 27:31](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27.md)) — to see only the sphere you're standing in and deny the existence of what lies beyond it.

This is also the asymmetry of comprehension from [truth.md Part 5](../truth.md). Light comprehends darkness; darkness cannot comprehend light. A faithful scientist can comprehend *both* the physical and the spiritual. A person who rejects the spiritual *cannot* comprehend the spiritual from within a purely material framework — not because they're unintelligent, but because comprehension of light requires the quickening of the Spirit ([D&C 88:11](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md)).

---

## Part 2: The Adversary Disguises Truth — D&C 93:39 in Real Time

### The Warning

President Oaks warns:

> "You live in a season in which the adversary has become so effective at disguising truth that if you don't have the Holy Ghost, you will be deceived."

This is [D&C 93:39](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md) applied to the present moment:

> "And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from the children of men, and because of the tradition of their fathers."

The truth study traced the *mechanism* by which this happens:

1. **Light and truth forsake that evil one** ([D&C 93:37](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)) — light doesn't fight darkness; it *withdraws*
2. **Darkness cannot comprehend light** ([D&C 88:49](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md)) — once light withdraws, you can't even perceive what you've lost
3. **The Nephite pattern** from our [Helaman study](../helaman-ten-virgins.md): forget → less astonished → hard → blind → disbelieve → rationalize

President Oaks' warning maps perfectly: the adversary *disguises* truth. He doesn't destroy it — he can't. Truth "abideth and hath no end" ([D&C 88:66](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md)). But he can make it *look like* something else. He can surround it with enough noise that you can't discern the signal. This is why the Holy Ghost is essential — the Spirit quickens understanding ([D&C 88:11](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md)). Without that quickening, you lack the instrument to distinguish truth from imitation.

### "Don't Be Persuaded by False or Inaccurate Information"

President Oaks identifies the modern vectors: "An abundance of speculation and false information in podcasts and on social media surrounds us."

This is the "tradition of their fathers" updated to 2026. D&C 93:39 names two mechanisms for losing light: (1) disobedience and (2) tradition. Tradition isn't limited to inherited cultural practices — it's any *system of belief transmitted socially* that displaces truth. Social media algorithms and podcast echo chambers are tradition-transmission engines. They form communities of belief that reinforce themselves, and those communities can easily become what President Oaks describes: people who "question the truth of Church doctrine without knowing or even understanding the fulness of that doctrine."

The stake president's story illustrates this vividly. The young man who "decided to step away" had not encountered a devastating argument — he had simply been *surrounded* by people who didn't believe. "I have not heard anyone speak like that in months." The light hadn't been refuted. It had been drowned out by ambient darkness.

---

## Part 3: Humility as Comprehension — The Prerequisite for Receiving Light

### Humility = Teachableness

President Kimball's definition, quoted by President Oaks:

> "Humility is teachableness—an ability to realize that all virtues and abilities are not concentrated in one's self."

In the language of the truth study, this is a statement about *capacity to comprehend.* To comprehend light, the observer must be refined enough to perceive it — "discerned by purer eyes" ([D&C 131:7](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131.md)). Pride is a form of darkness — a conviction that your current sphere of knowledge is sufficient, that you already comprehend. Humility is the acknowledgment that you do not yet comprehend all things — that "man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend" ([Mosiah 4:9](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.md)).

This connects to the [truth study's key insight on comprehension](../truth.md):

> **Comprehension is not merely intellectual — it is ontological.** To comprehend light, you must be *made of* light. To be darkness is to be structurally incapable of containing what light is.

Humility is the *spiritual disposition* that opens you to further light. Pride is the disposition that blocks it. Not because God withholds — but because a mind full of itself has no room for what God would give.

### "A Master Virtue"

President Oaks calls humility "a master virtue, given to help us learn other virtues necessary for us to become what our Heavenly Father and His Only Begotten Son created us to become."

A *master virtue* — one that unlocks all others. In our framework: humility is the spiritual equivalent of the instrument calibration that allows you to detect finer signals. Without it, further refinement on the matter spectrum is impossible. You can't move from grace to grace if you believe you've already arrived.

This maps to the Lectures on Faith framework from our [faith study](../faith-01.md): faith is the "principle of action" and "principle of power." But faith requires something President Oaks identifies — faith requires *more than strong desire.* "It means daily trying, one step at a time." Faith is belief + action, and humility is the disposition that sustains both.

### The Ten Virgins Connection

President Oaks makes a striking interpretive move. He calls the five wise virgins "the five humble ones." Our [Ten Virgins study](../ten-virgins-parable.md) established Elder Bednar's framework: lamps = testimony, oil = conversion. The Lord's own interpretation in [D&C 45:56-57](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.md) says the wise are those who:

1. Have received the truth
2. Have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide
3. Have not been deceived

President Oaks adds: the wise are **humble.** That's not replacing the other interpretations — it's adding a layer. Humility is *how* you receive truth (you must be teachable). Humility is *how* you take the Holy Spirit as your guide (you must be willing to listen). Humility is *how* you avoid deception (you must be willing to admit what you don't know).

The five foolish virgins weren't evil. They were at the wedding. They had lamps. They wanted the bridegroom to come. But they lacked the *internal disposition* — the oil, the conversion, the humility — that would sustain their light through the long wait.

---

## Part 4: Light Cleaveth unto Light — Seeking Help from Others

### "Surround Yourself with People Who Believe"

President Oaks' third point is a direct application of [D&C 88:40](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md):

> "Intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence; wisdom receiveth wisdom; truth embraceth truth; virtue loveth virtue; light cleaveth unto light."

This isn't just social advice. It's *physics* — spiritual physics. Light cleaveth unto light the way gravity draws mass to mass. The principle is built into the structure of reality. When you surround yourself with people who carry light, your light is reinforced, amplified, sustained. When you surround yourself with people in darkness, your light is not *attacked* — it is *unsupported.* It has nothing to cleave to. And eventually, "light and truth forsake that evil one" ([D&C 93:37](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)).

The stake president story is the proof text. The young man had not lost light through argument. He had lost it through *isolation from light.* "I have been hanging out with friends who don't believe." He was cut off from the principle of D&C 88:40. Truth had nothing to embrace. Light had nothing to cleave to. And it was withdrawing.

The remedy — hearing the stake president's testimony — was the re-introduction of light into the young man's environment. "I have not heard anyone speak like that in months." The tears came because light *recognizes* light. Even diminished light responds to the presence of more light. The pilot light can still catch fire if fuel is brought near.

### Mosiah 4:9-10 — Comprehension and Humility Together

President Oaks quotes King Benjamin:

> "Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend."

The word **comprehend** in Mosiah 4:9 is the same word we traced through [Abraham 4:4](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/4.md) ("the Gods comprehended the light") and [D&C 88:49](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md) ("the darkness comprehendeth it not") and [D&C 88:67](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md) ("that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things").

King Benjamin's statement is an ontological reality claim: man *does not yet* comprehend all things. The Gods comprehend. Christ comprehended all things ([D&C 88:6](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md)). We do not. And the path to comprehension — step by step, grace for grace — requires humility to acknowledge the gap and faith to keep walking.

---

## Part 5: Patience as Grace-for-Grace

### "We Are All a Work in Progress"

President Oaks' fourth point — be patient — sounds simple. But it's the practical expression of the deepest progression doctrine we have:

> "He received not of the fulness at first, but continued from grace to grace, until he received a fulness."
> — [D&C 93:13](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)

Even Christ progressed. Even He received "not of the fulness at first." If the Son of God learned line upon line, surely we can extend patience to ourselves and each other.

President Oaks directly addresses the tension:

> "Overcoming doubt—resolving conflicts between the evolving understanding of science and the sometimes incomplete teachings of religion—can be a lengthy process, as with building faith or acquiring humility."

Notice the framing: science is "evolving understanding" and religion has "sometimes incomplete teachings." Neither is presented as having final, total knowledge *right now.* Both are on a trajectory. This is the grace-for-grace principle applied to entire epistemological systems — both scientific and religious knowledge are progressive revelations, moving toward the fulness that only God currently possesses.

Our truth study arrived at the same conclusion:

> **Truth is "knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come"** — the full, unabridged version of reality. Mortals have only partial access to that full picture. Science discovers partial truth. Prophets reveal partial truth. God knows all truth. "God has not told us all he knows."

The instruction? "Hold on to the first article of faith, even if something else is uncertain." Anchor to what you *do* know — God, Christ, Holy Ghost — while you wait for further light. Don't abandon the foundation because you haven't yet built the roof.

---

## Part 6: The Mantle — Authority and Spiritual Refinement

President Oaks opens with something few prophets have described so personally — the experience of receiving the prophetic mantle:

> "Within a few minutes after learning of our president's death, I felt the heaviness of responsibility settle upon me, along with important impressions of what I was required to do now."

And about President Nelson:

> "When the mantle of the prophet settled upon President Nelson, I felt that his prophetic gifts were magnified."

This is the matter spectrum in action. The prophetic mantle isn't merely an administrative transfer — it's a *spiritual endowment* that refines the receiver's capacity to comprehend and communicate truth. "Prophetic gifts were magnified" — the same intelligence, the same man, but now operating with greater light. The doctrine says "he that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is glorified in truth and knoweth all things" ([D&C 93:28](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)). The mantle is acute acceleration of that principle.

## Synthesis: What the Prophet Confirmed

President Oaks' first devotional as prophet, mapped against the truth framework:

| President Oaks' Teaching | Scriptural/Study Parallel |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Two methods of gaining knowledge — scientific and spiritual | [Truth.md Insight #3](../truth.md): "The scientific method is a form of revelation" — both discover truth that cannot be created |
| "No ultimate conflict" between these methods | [D&C 93:29-30](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md): Truth is independent in its sphere; all spheres belong to God |
| "Science is simply man's discovering a few things that God already knows" | [Truth.md Part 4](../truth.md): Mathematics is eternal law; $E = mc^2$ was true before Einstein |
| "Never let your secular learning limit your horizons" | [D&C 29:34](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.md): All things are spiritual; scientific truth is a *subset* of total truth |
| Adversary "disguising truth" | [D&C 93:39](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md): Light taken through disobedience and tradition; [truth.md Part 5](../truth.md) asymmetry |
| Humility = teachableness | Comprehension requires refined observer ([D&C 131:7](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131.md)); pride is darkness blocking light |
| Humility as "master virtue" | Prerequisite for receiving further light ([D&C 93:28](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)): commandments → truth → glory |
| The five "humble" virgins | [Ten Virgins study](../ten-virgins-parable.md): oil = conversion = humility that sustains through the long wait |
| "Intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence" lived out | [D&C 88:40](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md): Light cleaveth unto light; isolation from light starves faith |
| "Man doth not comprehend all things" | [Abraham 4:4](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/4.md) vs [D&C 88:49](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md): Gods comprehend; we are learning to |
| Grace for grace — patience with the process | [D&C 93:12-13](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md): Even Christ progressed gradually; [D&C 130:18](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.md) |
| Prophetic mantle magnifies gifts | The matter spectrum — refinement increases capacity to comprehend and transmit light |

## Become

1. **Don't pit science against faith.** President Oaks says both methods discover truth. The truth study shows *why* — truth is eternal and independent in its sphere. Science discovers truth within the physical sphere. Revelation discloses truth across all spheres. Neither threatens the other when you understand the framework.

2. **Choose your environment deliberately.** The stake president's story isn't a parable — it's a case study in spiritual physics. Light cleaveth unto light. If you surround yourself with darkness, your light will starve — not because anyone attacked it, but because it had nothing to cleave to. Seek friends who carry light.

3. **Practice humility as instrument calibration.** Humility isn't weakness. It's the acknowledgment that your current resolution isn't high enough to see everything. It's the willingness to refine your eyes so you can discern finer matter, hear quieter signals. Every act of humility increases your capacity to receive.

4. **Hold the anchor, even in fog.** "Hold on to the first article of faith, even if something else is uncertain." You don't need to see the whole picture to know where north is. God, Christ, Holy Ghost — that's the anchor. Navigate by it even when the weather obscures the horizon.

5. **Be patient with the grace-for-grace process.** Even Christ received "not of the fulness at first." If we expect instant resolution of every doubt, we're imposing a timeline that even the Son of God didn't follow. Truth unfolds. Light increases. The process is the point.

6. **Watch for the withdrawal of light.** When scripture study feels dry, when church feels routine, when God seems distant — that's not evidence that God has left. That's often the early signal that light is withdrawing because of disobedience or distraction. The fix is always the same: keep the commandments, receive truth and light, grace for grace.
