# Marp Slide Reformation Plan

Reorganizing Morgan Philpot's 369-slide deck into a **verbal-first** Marp presentation that follows what the Chandler audience actually heard.

---

## Approach

The original `slides.md` is organized by slide number (1–369). The transcript review revealed the verbal delivery follows a completely different order, with ~40% of slides never discussed and ~70 verbal-only items never on slides.

**Strategy:** Create 4 Marp files organized by the actual presentation flow:

| File | Content | Estimated Slides |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| `part1_marp.md` | Part I verbal flow (~0:00–1:24:00) | ~50–60 slides |
| `part2_marp.md` | Part II verbal flow (~0:00–1:11:00) | ~50–60 slides |
| `part3_marp.md` | Part III verbal flow (~0:00–1:00:00) | ~35–45 slides |
| `appendix_marp.md` | Slide-only content (never verbally discussed) | ~80–100 slides |

**Conventions:**
- Original slide numbers preserved in presenter notes: `<!-- Original slide 42 -->`
- Verbal-only content marked: `<!-- Verbal-only — no original slide -->`
- Presenter notes include transcript timestamps and key quotes
- Each deck has Marp front matter with consistent theming
