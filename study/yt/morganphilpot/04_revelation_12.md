# Phase 4: Revelation 12 — The Woman, Child & Dragon

> Morgan Philpot — *Signs of the Times* (Chandler, AZ, 2025)
> Slides 121–148 | Part I Transcript (~28:00–40:00)

**Evaluation Focus:** Is the Council of Fifty = "man child" interpretation supportable from JST Revelation 12? Is the jubilee cycle math (time/times/half = 50 + 100 + 25 = 175) standard biblical interpretation or novel? The 2022 endpoint is a testable claim — what has happened since?

**Bias Alert:** The Council of Fifty and "Prophet, Priest, and King" material draws from historical sources outside the standard works (William Clayton journal, josephsmithpapers.org). Evaluate this on the merits of the JST text and historical record, not on whether it fits comfortable narratives.

## Step 1: Summary

### Main Thesis

Where Phase 3 built the theological architecture (Deuteronomy covenant pattern, Constitution, Restoration as "the Return"), Phase 4 drops into the heart of John's Revelation to map the *Restoration itself* onto a cosmic drama. Philpot reads JST Revelation 12 as a prophetic blueprint of the last dispensation: the woman is the Church of God (JST Rev 12:7 makes this explicit), the man child is the Kingdom of God organized as the Council of Fifty (March 11, 1844), the dragon's "third part of the stars" are the original Twelve Apostles who fell away, the martyrdom of Joseph Smith is the child "caught up unto God and his throne" (JST Rev 12:3), and the woman fleeing into the wilderness is the pioneer exodus to Utah (1846–47).

The climactic move is a jubilee-cycle interpretation of "a time, and times, and half a time" (JST Rev 12:14). Since Leviticus 25 defines the jubilee as fifty years, Philpot reads *a time* = 50 years, *times* = 100 years, *half a time* = 25 years, totaling 175 years. Beginning from 1847 (when the Saints entered their promised land), this yields 2022 as the *expiration* of the nourishment period — after which the dragon "goes to make war with the remnant" (Rev 12:17) and the saints become "collateral damage" (Rev 13:7).

### Key Claims

1. **JST Rev 12:7 — Woman = Church of God** — "The woman which was the church of God, who had been delivered of her pains, and brought forth the kingdom of our God and his Christ" (slide 123)
2. **Church organized April 6, 1830** — D&C 20:1; Philpot notes April 7, 1830 = Jewish Passover (slide 124)
3. **Man child = Council of Fifty** — Organized March 11, 1844. William Clayton journal: "In this Council was President Joseph Smith chosen our Prophet, Priest, and King by Hosannas" (slide 126)
4. **Twelve stars = Twelve Apostles** — Crown of twelve stars (JST Rev 12:1) = apostolic authority; the "third part" drawn away = four who permanently left (slides 128–132)
5. **Joseph martyred = "child caught up unto God"** — June 27, 1844 (slides 133, 139–140; D&C 135)
6. **Daniel 2:44 stone kingdom** — "In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom" aligns with Council of Fifty organization (slides 134–136)
7. **Woman flees to wilderness = pioneer trek (1846–47)** — "Two wings of a great eagle" = permission from US Congress via Council of Fifty (slides 142–144)
8. **Jubilee cycle interpretation** — "A time" = 50 years, "times" = 100, "half a time" = 25 → 175 years (slide 147)
9. **1847 + 175 = 2022** — The claimed expiration of the Church's nourishment/protection period (slide 147)
10. **After 2022 → dragon makes war with remnant** — Rev 12:17, 13:7: "It was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them" (slide 148)

## Step 3: Evaluation

### In Line

**1. JST Revelation 12:7 — The Woman IS the Church of God**

This is not interpretation — it is the text itself:

> "The dragon prevailed not against Michael, neither the child, nor **the woman which was the church of God, who had been delivered of her pains, and brought forth the kingdom of our God and his Christ**." — [JST Revelation 12:7](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/jst/jst-rev/12.md)

Joseph Smith's inspired translation explicitly identifies the woman as "the church of God." The KJV is symbolic and obscure; the JST is definitional. Philpot's identification of the woman as the restored Church is textually airtight. This is one of the cases where the JST adds doctrinal clarity that no other Christian tradition possesses, which is Philpot's larger point: "Revelation is a book that can only be read and understood by Latter-day Saints. Nobody else has the tools to understand it."

**2. Church Organization on April 6, 1830**

[D&C 20:1](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.md) connects the organization of the Church to apostolic authority:

> "The rise of the Church of Christ in these last days... in the fourth month, and on the sixth day of the month which is called April."

This is canonical and incontestable. The Church *is* the woman, and the woman appeared in the latter days.

**3. D&C 135 — The Martyrdom as Covenant-Sealing Event**

Philpot reads Joseph's martyrdom as the moment "her child was caught up unto God and his throne" ([JST Rev 12:3](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/jst/jst-rev/12.md)). The language of D&C 135 powerfully supports the typological weight he places on the event:

> "Their *innocent blood* on the banner of liberty, and on the *magna charta* of the United States, is an ambassador for the religion of Jesus Christ, that will touch the hearts of honest men among all nations; and their *innocent blood,* with the innocent blood of all the martyrs under the altar that John saw, will cry unto the Lord of Hosts till he avenges that blood on the earth." — [D&C 135:7](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/135.md)

Note that D&C 135:7 *itself* links Joseph's blood to John's Revelation ("under the altar that John saw" — Rev 6:9). The martyrdom is framed in scripture as an eschatological event, not merely a historical one. This is already the language of Revelation.

**4. The Pioneer Exodus as "Fleeing to the Wilderness"**

JST Revelation 12:14: "To the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might flee into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent."

The Saints literally fled westward (1846–47) to a wilderness location prepared for them. The image of "two wings of a great eagle" connects naturally to the United States (the eagle as national symbol). Philpot adds in the transcript that this occurred "with the permission of the US Congress because of the appeal by the Council of 50 in 1844." The typological connection between Brigham Young leading the Saints to a prepared wilderness and the JST text is strong and natural.

**5. D&C 112:30 — Priesthood Given to the Twelve "for the Last Time"**

> "For unto you, the Twelve, and those, the First Presidency, who are appointed with you to be your counselors and your leaders, is the power of this priesthood given, for the last days and for the last time." — [D&C 112:30](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/112.md)

Philpot uses this to establish that the "twelve stars" of the woman's crown ([JST Rev 12:1](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/jst/jst-rev/12.md)) represent the Twelve Apostles of the Restoration. This is a reasonable typological reading. The header of D&C 112 itself notes this revelation was given to "Thomas B. Marsh, President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles" — and the section addresses apostolic authority in the dispensation of the fulness of times.

**6. Daniel 2:44 — "In the Days of These Kings"**

> "And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever." — [Daniel 2:44](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/dan/2.md)

Latter-day Saint prophets have consistently identified Daniel's stone-kingdom with the Restoration. [D&C 65:2](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/65.md) makes this explicit: "The stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth, until it has filled the whole earth." Philpot's connection of Daniel 2 to the organization of the kingdom is doctrinally mainstream.

**7. The "Third Part of the Stars" = Four Permanent Apostle Defections**

In the transcript, Philpot is precise about his math: "How many of the original 12 apostles left the church? Eight. Four came back and four left and never came back. So four of Joseph's original 12 apostles just as the book of Revelation says were drawn away and never came back."

4 of 12 = exactly one-third. The permanently excommunicated apostles were Lyman E. Johnson, William E. McLellin, John F. Boynton, and William Smith. The remaining four who had issues (Orson Hyde, Luke Johnson, Orson Pratt, Thomas B. Marsh) were all eventually restored. Philpot's reading correctly distinguishes between those who were temporarily lost and those who were permanently "drawn away."

The KJV footnote for "third" at [Revelation 12:4](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/rev/12.md) points to [D&C 29:36](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.md) and the Topical Guide entry "Sons of Perdition" — the standard reading is about spirits lost in the War in Heaven. Philpot is applying the heavenly pattern to its earthly recurrence, which the JST *invites* by saying the vision is "a great sign in heaven, in the likeness of things on the earth" ([JST Rev 12:1](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/jst/jst-rev/12.md)). That phrase — "in the likeness of things on the earth" — is unique to the JST and explicitly licenses dual application.

---

### Nuanced

**1. The Council of Fifty = "Man Child"**

This is the central interpretive claim of Phase 4 and the most historically complex.

The JST text says: "She brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up unto God and his throne" ([JST Rev 12:3](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/jst/jst-rev/12.md)). The woman (Church) then "brought forth the kingdom of our God and his Christ" (v. 7).

Philpot identifies the "man child" as the Council of Fifty — organized March 11, 1844 — which Joseph Smith Papers describes as "the beginning of the government of the literal kingdom of God on earth." The William Clayton journal records that Joseph was "chosen our Prophet, Priest, and King by Hosannas."

**What supports this reading:**
- The JST explicitly says the woman (church) "brought forth the kingdom of our God" (v. 7). The Council of Fifty was the organizational expression of that kingdom.
- The Council of Fifty did receive a revelatory name: "The Kingdom of God and his Laws, with the Keys and power thereof, and judgment in the hands of his servants, Ahman Christ" (William Clayton Journal, 153–154).
- The historical sequence matches: Church organized (1830) → Kingdom organized (1844) → Prophet martyred (1844) → Church flees to wilderness (1846–47). This maps perfectly onto JST Rev 12:3–5: woman → child born → child caught up → woman flees.
- josephsmithpapers.org confirms these historical facts. The William Clayton minutes were released for research in the Joseph Smith Papers project.

**What complicates this reading:**
- "Rule all nations with a rod of iron" is language applied to *Christ* in [Psalm 2:9](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/ps/2.md) and [Revelation 19:15](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/rev/19.md). Applying it to a political council is a significant interpretive move.
- The KJV reading's standard interpretation identifies the man child as Christ himself (born of the Church/Israel, caught up to God's throne at the Ascension). The JST doesn't contradict this outright but adds the language "the kingdom of our God and his Christ" which is broader than Christ alone.
- The Council of Fifty is not mentioned in any canonized scripture. The connection depends entirely on historical sources (William Clayton, Joseph Smith Papers).
- The phrase "Prophet, Priest, and King" for Joseph Smith is from Clayton's journal. While historically attested, this characterization has not been adopted into official Church teaching.

**Assessment:** The *historical sequence* (church → kingdom → martyrdom → exodus) is undeniable. The *textual connection* (JST Rev 12:7 says the woman "brought forth the kingdom") is real. The identification is creative and historically grounded, but relies on extra-canonical sources for its specificity. It is a *plausible* typological reading, not a *definitive* one.

**2. Karl Marx as a Satanic Counterpart Prophet (Transcript Only)**

In the transcript (not on slides), Philpot makes a provocative claim: "A new prophet is raised up. Karl Marx is born in 1818... and he will be a European Eastern prophet preaching against religion and theology." He positions Marx as the dragon's response to constitutional republicanism — a counterfeit ideology to compete with the Lord's work.

This is not a scriptural claim but a historical-theological one. There is scriptural precedent for the idea that Satan raises up counterfeit systems: [2 Nephi 28:20–21](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.md) describes Satan stirring up people to anger, lulling them to carnal security, and cheating their souls. D&C 10:7 warns of Satan's designs. Marx's explicit program of eliminating "theology and religion" and replacing it with "earth, law and politics" does align with the pattern. But calling Marx a "prophet" of Satan is Philpot's rhetorical framing, not a scriptural claim.

**3. April 7, 1830 = Jewish Passover**

Philpot notes that the day after the Church's organization (April 7, 1830) "is believed to have been Jewish Passover." This is an interesting typological connection — the Church being organized the day before Passover. However, Jewish calendar conversions for 1830 require astronomical calculation, and the claim needs independent verification. Even if correct, Philpot himself presents it as a note rather than a load-bearing argument.

---

### Out of Line

**1. The Jubilee Cycle Interpretation — "Time = 50, Times = 100, Half = 25 = 175 Years"**

This is the most consequential claim in Phase 4 and the most difficult to defend.

**The standard biblical interpretation** of "a time, times, and half a time" across all three occurrences — [Daniel 7:25](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/dan/7.md), [Daniel 12:7](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/dan/12.md), and [Revelation 12:14](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/rev/12.md) — is **3.5 years** (1 + 2 + 0.5). This is explicitly confirmed by the internal cross-references in Revelation itself:

- [Revelation 12:6](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/rev/12.md): "a thousand two hundred and threescore days" = 1,260 days
- [Revelation 12:14](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/rev/12.md): "a time, and times, and half a time"
- [Revelation 13:5](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/rev/13.md): "forty and two months"

These three expressions describe the *same period* and are mathematically equivalent: 1,260 days = 42 months = 3.5 years. The parallel structure within Revelation's own text makes this one of the clearest internal definitions in apocalyptic literature.

**Philpot's move** is to redefine "a time" as a jubilee cycle of 50 years rather than 1 year. This produces: 50 + 100 + 25 = 175 years. Starting from 1847: **1847 + 175 = 2022**.

**Problems with this reading:**

1. **The text defines itself.** JST Revelation 12:5 says the woman fled to the wilderness "a thousand two hundred and threescore *years*" — the JST changes "days" to "years." But verse 14 uses "a time, and times, and half a time." If "a time" meant a jubilee, verses 5 and 14 would produce wildly different numbers (1,260 years vs. 175 years) for what appears to be the same event. The text most naturally reads as two expressions for the same period using different scales.

2. **No biblical, scholarly, or prophetic precedent.** Webster 1828 defines jubilee as "every fiftieth year" (Lev 25:8–17), which is correct. But nowhere in the biblical text or in any prophetic commentary is "a time" equated with "a jubilee." The phrase "a time, times, and half a time" has a consistent meaning across Daniel and Revelation, and that meaning is 3.5 units — whether rendered as years, prophetic days-as-years, or other scales. Philpot is introducing a novel unit of measurement.

3. **It produces a specific date — 2022.** As noted in the [Phase 2 evaluation](02_signs_and_warnings.md), date-setting has the same structural problem regardless of its mechanism. President Dallin H. Oaks has taught: "What I am saying is that the Lord is not going to come and the prophets have not set a date. The Lord has not set a date, and we should not set dates" (more recently: "The Lord will come when he will come"). The jubilee math, however creative, produces the same kind of testable prediction that prophets have consistently cautioned against.

4. **1897 jubilee citation is thin.** Philpot cites an "Elder Anthon" from the October 1897 Conference Report saying "This has been our Jubilee year, fifty years since we arrived in these mountains." This is a historical observation about a 50-year anniversary, not a prophetic declaration that the Levitical jubilee clock had begun. People naturally celebrate golden anniversaries. That doesn't activate the Levitical calendar.

**Assessment:** The jubilee reading is creative but novel. It contradicts the self-interpreting structure of Revelation 12–13, has no precedent in LDS prophetic commentary, and produces a specific date — which is the recurring weakness in Philpot's framework.

**2. 2022 as "the Expiration of the Nourishment Period"**

Philpot claims: "The protection should come off" in 2022. In the transcript, he asks: "If the protection came off, what would that look like? Would it be political?"

We are now in February 2026 — four years past this claimed expiration. This is a testable claim. What has actually happened?

- The Church continues to grow globally, with temples announced and dedicated at an unprecedented pace (President Nelson announced 185+ temples by the end of his ministry).
- The Church has not been "overcome" in any measurable institutional sense.
- There has been increased cultural friction (the Michigan church burning Philpot mentions; rising hostility toward religious institutions generally) — but this is a continuation of trends predating 2022, not a rupture.
- Philpot cites Elder Hales's 2013 observation that "the honeymoon stage with the rest of the world is over" — but that was nine years *before* the claimed nourishment expiration.

The ambiguity of the prediction makes it unfalsifiable in practice: any persecution can be fit into the framework after the fact, and any prosperity can be explained as "the dragon hasn't fully attacked yet." This is the definition of a non-testable claim dressed as a testable one.

---

### Missed the Mark

**1. JST Rev 12:5 vs. 12:14 — Two Different Periods, Not One**

Philpot collapses the "thousand two hundred and threescore years" (v. 5) and the "time, times, and half a time" (v. 14) into different measurements for the pioneer-era Church specifically. But the JST text describes *two different events*:

- **Verse 5:** "The woman fled into the wilderness, where she had a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore years." — This describes the *Great Apostasy*, the long period between the primitive Church and the Restoration. 1,260 years from the early centuries of Christianity maps to the medieval/Reformation period.

- **Verse 14:** "To the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might flee into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent." — This describes a *second* flight, after the restoration of the Church (the dragon's renewed persecution).

The JST's verse order is deliberately changed from the KJV (as the chapter header notes: "Note the changed sequence of verses in the JST"). The resequencing distinguishes the *ancient apostasy* (v. 5) from the *latter-day flight* (v. 14). Philpot applies verse 14 to the pioneer trek, which is reasonable — but his jubilee arithmetic ignores the fact that the text already provides a time measurement for the apostasy period (1,260 years) and a *separate, deliberately different* expression ("time, times, half a time") for the latter-day period. By redefining the units, he inadvertently erases the literary distinction the JST is making.

**2. Leviticus 25 Jubilee Is About *Land* Economics, Not Prophetic Timekeeping**

The jubilee in [Leviticus 25](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/lev/25.md) is a law governing the sale and redemption of *land and servants*. Its purpose is stated in verse 10: "Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof." It regulates property cycles: lands return to original owners, Hebrew servants go free, debts are released.

Philpot's move — connecting "when ye come into the land" (Lev 25:2) to the pioneers arriving in Utah — is typologically creative. But the jubilee was never used as a unit of prophetic time measurement in any biblical or Restoration text. It is an *economic institution*, not a *chronological unit*. Applying it as a multiplier for apocalyptic language conflates two different biblical systems: the legal/economic code of Leviticus and the prophetic/apocalyptic language of Daniel and Revelation.

---

### Missed Opportunities

**1. D&C 65 — The Stone Rolling Forth**

D&C 65:2 provides the Lord's own interpretation of Daniel 2:44: "The keys of the kingdom of God are committed unto man on the earth, and from thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth, until it has filled the whole earth." Verse 5–6 adds: "The Son of Man shall come down in heaven, clothed in the brightness of his glory, to meet the kingdom of God which is set up on the earth."

This passage identifies the stone-kingdom as the *gospel rolling forth* — a missionary, covenantal expansion — not as a political organization like the Council of Fifty. Using D&C 65 would have strengthened the Daniel 2 connection while anchoring it in canonized revelation rather than the William Clayton journal.

**2. D&C 29:36–38 — The Original "Third Part" Context**

The KJV footnote at [Revelation 12:4](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/rev/12.md) points to [D&C 29:36](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.md): "A third part of the hosts of heaven turned he away from me because of their agency." Engaging with the *canonical* interpretation of the "third part" and then showing how the earthly pattern mirrors the heavenly one would have deepened the argument. The JST's own phrase — "in the likeness of things on the earth" — invites this exact move. Instead, Philpot jumps straight to the earthly apostles without first establishing the heavenly precedent.

**3. D&C 87 — The Prophecy on War**

Philpot mentions D&C 87 in passing in the transcript ("he'll bring a full end of all nations") but never develops it. D&C 87:1–3 prophesies the Civil War beginning in South Carolina and spreading to "all nations" — this is *directly relevant* to his argument about the US government's corruption after the martyrdom and the Civil War as the beast's deadly wound that heals. A careful reading of D&C 87:6–8 would have grounded his Civil War discussion in canonized prophecy.

**4. President Boyd K. Packer — "The Twelve" (April 2008)**

President Packer taught: "The most precious thing lost in the Apostasy was the authority held by the Twelve — the priesthood keys. For the Church to be His Church, there must be a Quorum of the Twelve who hold the keys and confer them on others." This apostolic framing would have reinforced Philpot's reading of the "twelve stars" as apostolic authority while keeping the discussion anchored in prophetic teaching.

---

### Overall Assessment

Phase 4 divides cleanly into two halves with very different evidentiary quality.

**The scriptural/historical half is strong.** JST Revelation 12 explicitly identifies the woman as the Church, and the JST's unique phrase "in the likeness of things on the earth" licenses the kind of Restoration-era typological reading Philpot performs. The sequence — Church organized → kingdom organized → prophet martyred → Saints flee to wilderness — maps remarkably onto JST Rev 12:3–5, 14. The Council of Fifty identification is not provable from canonized scripture alone, but it is historically grounded and textually plausible. The martyrdom as a cosmic event is already the language of D&C 135.

**The jubilee-math half is the weakest argument in the entire series.** It redefines a self-interpreting unit of measure ("time, times, and half a time" = 3.5 units, confirmed by Revelation's own cross-references to 1,260 days and 42 months) into a novel jubilee-based calculation with no biblical, scholarly, or prophetic precedent. It produces a specific date (2022) in tension with prophetic counsel against date-setting. And it misses the JST's own internal structure, which distinguishes the 1,260-year apostasy (v. 5) from the latter-day period (v. 14).

The pattern from Phase 2 repeats: Philpot's *textual* work is careful and his *historical* sourcing is serious, but when he shifts from exegesis to arithmetic, he enters territory that prophets have consistently warned against. The strongest parts of this phase are the parts that stay closest to the JST text.

### Truths to Carry

1. **JST Revelation 12 is a treasure.** The JST changes to Revelation 12 are among the most significant doctrinal additions Joseph Smith made to any biblical text. "The woman which was the church of God, who had been delivered of her pains, and brought forth the kingdom of our God and his Christ" — this single verse transforms an opaque apocalyptic symbol into a clear Restoration narrative. I should study the full JST more carefully.

2. **The earthly recurrence.** "A great sign in heaven, in the likeness of things on the earth" — this JST phrase is a hermeneutic key. It means Revelation 12 is *meant* to have both a heavenly and an earthly fulfillment. The War in Heaven did not end; it continued on earth. The patterns repeat. I should look for other "likeness" patterns across scripture.

3. **D&C 135:7 links past and future.** Joseph's blood "with the innocent blood of all the martyrs under the altar that John saw, will cry unto the Lord of Hosts till he avenges that blood on the earth." The martyrdom is not merely a historical tragedy — it is an unresolved covenant claim that connects directly to John's apocalyptic vision. This changes how I read both D&C 135 and Revelation 6:9–11.

### Warnings to Heed

1. **Arithmetic is not exegesis.** When a scriptural interpretation requires redefining established units of measurement to produce a specific date, that is a warning sign — even when the broader reading is textually sound. The jubilee calculation (50 + 100 + 25 = 175) is clever, but cleverness is not the same as truth. Stay with the text.

2. **Extra-canonical sources require extra humility.** The William Clayton journal is a real historical document. The Council of Fifty is a real historical institution. But "Prophet, Priest, and King" is not a title the Lord gave Joseph in any canonized revelation. When building theology on historical sources, hold the conclusions more loosely than when building on scripture.

### Personal Commitments

1. **Study the full JST Appendix.** I've encountered JST Revelation 12 in this evaluation, but the JST Appendix contains many other inspired changes. I commit to reading the complete set of JST changes in the NT within the next month, beginning with the other JST Revelation passages.

2. **Follow the footnote from Rev 12:4 to D&C 29:36.** The connection between the War in Heaven and the latter-day apostasy of leaders deserves deeper study. I will read D&C 29:36–43 in full context and trace the "third part" theme across scripture.

3. **Read the Joseph Smith Papers material on the Council of Fifty.** Not to build theology on it, but to understand what actually happened historically. A committee of faithful LDS scholars at the Church's own initiative made these records available. Understanding our own history is not dangerous; it's important.
