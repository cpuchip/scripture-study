Spring 1830 – April 6

Organization of Church

Doctrine and Covenants 20:1 The rise of The Church of Christ in these last days, being one thousand eight hundred and thirty years since the coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in the flesh… by the will and commandments of God, in the fourth month, and on the sixth day of the month which is called April—

Summer is Now Nigh at Hand

D&C 45:

36 And when the light shall begin to break forth, it shall be with them like unto a parable which I will show you—

37 Ye look and behold the fig trees… and ye say when they begin to shoot forth, and their leaves are yet tender, that summer is now nigh at hand;

38 Even so it shall be in that day when they shall see all these things, then shall they know that the hour is nigh.

39 And it shall come to pass that he that feareth me shall be looking forth for the great day of the Lord to come, even for the signs of the coming of the Son of Man.

40 And they shall see signs and wonders, for they shall be shown forth in the heavens above, and in the earth beneath.

## Slide 7

PASSOVER (& Other Divine Feasts)

---

## Slide 8

Passover

Deuteronomy 16:

1 Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the Lord thy God: for in the month of Abib the Lord thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night.

---

## Slide 9

Passover - Abib

In Hebrew, Abib means “green” or “newly ripened ears of grain”— (see Leviticus 2:14).��It is associated with Spring.

---

## Slide 10

Passover – Day 10

Exodus 12:

1 And the Lord spake unto Moses… saying,

2 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.

3 …In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:

---

## Slide 11

Passover – Day 14

Exodus 12:

5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:

6 And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.

8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night…

​

---

## Slide 12

Passover vs. Passover Week

Passover in Old Testament tradition began upon the sighting of the new moon around Spring Equinox, along with the sighting of the new and ripening ears of barley grain.��Passover week started with the bringing of the unblemished lamb into the family household on the 10th day of the first month of the year – Nisan – in preparation for the killing of the lamb and the Passover meal.

---

## Slide 13

Passover Week – Day 4

3 Nephi 8:

2 And now it came to pass, if there was no mistake made by this man in the reckoning of our time, the thirty and third year had passed away;

5 And it came to pass in the thirty and fourth year, in the first month, on the fourth day of the month, there arose a great storm, such an one as never had been known in all the land.

---

## Slide 14

Passover Week – Day 4

3 Nephi 8:

3 And the people began to look with great earnestness for the sign which had been given by the prophet Samuel, the Lamanite, yea, for the time that there should be darkness for the space of three days over the face of the land.

---

## Slide 15

Passover Week – Day 4

3 Nephi 8:

19 And it came to pass that when the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the storm, and the tempest, and the quakings of the earth did cease—for behold, they did last for about the space of three hours; and it was said by some that the time was greater; nevertheless, all these great and terrible things were done in about the space of three hours—and then behold, there was darkness upon the face of the land.

---

## Slide 16

Passover – Timing

-We have no way to correctly reckon time

-The Julian calendar is relative

-Modern rabbinic acknowledgment: Rabbi Dr. Louis Jacobs (The Jewish Religion: A Companion, 1995):“There is no pretense that our calendar reproduces the precise times used in Temple days; it is a stable approximation instituted for unity of observance.”

-All we can do is try to understand the types and signs that the Lord has set up

---

## Slide 17

Passover – Symbolism

The new moon marks the beginning of Abib, when the barley is nearly ripe.

The Passover full moon (Abib 14) occurs when the barley is ready to harvest.

The wave sheaf is the first ripe barley, offered before any general harvest — and Christ fulfills that day precisely by rising from the dead.

---

## Slide 18

Passover – Symbolism

“Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land... then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: And he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.”— Leviticus 23:10–11

​

That “sheaf” (omer of barley) was offered on the day after the Sabbath following Passover — the same day Jesus rose from the dead.

​

“But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.”— 1 Corinthians 15:20–21

---

## Slide 19

Passover – Symbolism

The barley harvest represents the first group of the redeemed — those prepared early, sanctified, and offered to God first. Christ was the literal Barley Sheaf — lifted up before the Father as the accepted firstfruits.

​

## Slide 22

The Wheat Harvest

Matthew 13:24 ¶ Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:

25 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.

---

## Slide 23

The Wheat Harvest

Matthew 13:37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;

38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;

39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.

## Slide 27

The Harvests

Summer

Grapes / Wine: Final judgment harvest

Vintage of the earth (Rev. 14:19–20)

---

## Slide 28

The Harvests

Fall – Olive harvest

Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot) — the “Feast of Ingathering”

Exodus 23:16“And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labors, which thou hast sown in the field; and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labors out of the field.”

“Feast of Ingathering” = harvest of olives and grapes — the completion of the year’s agricultural and spiritual cycle.

It symbolized dwelling with God, celebrating under temporary “booths” (Leviticus 23:33–43), foreshadowing the Millennial rest when the Lord Himself dwells among His people.

---

## Slide 29

The Harvests

Fall – Olive harvest

Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot) — the “Feast of Ingathering”

Coincides directly with the olive harvest:

Exodus 23:16“And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labors, which thou hast sown in the field; and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labors out of the field.”

“Feast of Ingathering” = harvest of olives and grapes — the completion of the year’s agricultural and spiritual cycle.

It symbolized dwelling with God, celebrating under temporary “booths” (Leviticus 23:33–43), foreshadowing the Millennial rest when the Lord Himself dwells among His people.

---

## Slide 30

The Harvests

Fall – Olive harvest

Olives = anointing and enthronement (Tabernacles / Ingathering).

The olive oil was the crown of the harvest — the essence extracted through pressing — and the token of kingship, light, and peace.

---

## Slide 31

The Harvests

Adam-ondi-Ahman — The Place of Anointing

Doctrine and Covenants 116 identifies Adam-ondi-Ahman as: “The place where Adam shall come to visit his people, or the Ancient of Days shall sit, as spoken of by Daniel the prophet.”(Daniel 7:9–14 describes this heavenly council scene.)

At Adam-ondi-Ahman:Adam (Ancient of Days), the first steward and patriarch, will preside in a grand priesthood assembly. The keys of all dispensations — from Adam down — will be returned to the Son of Man. Christ will be anointed and acknowledged as rightful King and Lord of the whole earth. This is the final covenant harvest — the Olive Harvest — when the oil of all dispensations is gathered and consecrated upon the head of the Messiah.

---

## Slide 32

The Harvests

The Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot), which follows the grape and olive harvest, celebrates this very moment — the Lord dwelling with His people, crowned as their King (Zechariah 14:9, 16–19).

---

## Slide 33

The Harvests

Zechariah 14:16 ¶ And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.

​

17 And it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain.

## Slide 42

What Nephi Saw – 1 Nephi 14

11 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the whore of all the earth, and she sat upon many waters; and she had dominion over all the earth, among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people.

12 And it came to pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of God, and its numbers were few, because of the wickedness and abominations of the whore who sat upon many waters; nevertheless, I beheld that the church of the Lamb, who were the saints of God, were also upon all the face of the earth; and their dominions upon the face of the earth were small, because of the wickedness of the great whore whom I saw.

---

## Slide 43

1 Nephi 14

13 And it came to pass that I beheld that the great mother of abominations did gather together multitudes upon the face of all the earth, among all the nations of the Gentiles, to fight against the Lamb of God.

---

## Slide 44

1 Nephi 14

14 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the power of the Lamb of God, that it descended upon the saints of the church of the Lamb, and upon the covenant people of the Lord, who were scattered upon all the face of the earth; and they were armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory.

---

## Slide 45

The Power of the Lamb – 1 Nephi 14

In coming days, we will see the greatest manifestations of the Savior’s power that the world has ever seen. Between now and the time He returns “with power and great glory,” He will bestow countless privileges, blessings, and miracles upon the faithful.”

---

## Slide 46

1 Nephi 14

15 And it came to pass that I beheld that the wrath of God was poured out upon that great and abominable church, insomuch that there were wars and rumors of wars among all the nations and kindreds of the earth.

16 And as there began to be wars and rumors of wars among all the nations which belonged to the mother of abominations, the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold, the wrath of God is upon the mother of harlots; and behold, thou seest all these things—

---

## Slide 47

What is the Wrath of God?

D&C 88:85

See Revelation 15 and 16

---

## Slide 48

1 Nephi 14

17 And when the day cometh that the wrath of God is poured out upon the mother of harlots, which is the great and abominable church of all the earth, whose founder is the devil, then, at that day, the work of the Father shall commence, in preparing the way for the fulfilling of his covenants, which he hath made to his people who are of the house of Israel.

“We are sparing no effort to give this venerable temple, which had become increasingly vulnerable, a foundation that will withstand the forces of nature into the Millennium.

Unprecedented times call for unprecedented measures.”

12 And blessed are the Gentiles, they of whom the prophet has written; for behold, if it so be that they shall repent and fight not against Zion, and do not unite themselves to that great and abominable church, they shall be saved; for the Lord God will fulfil his covenants which he has made unto his children; and for this cause the prophet has written these things.

In that war with the remnant, “the saints” will become collateral damage and he will overcome them.

“The Lord showed me by vision and revelation exactly what would take place if we did not stop this practice. If we had not stopped it, you would have had no use for … any of the men in this temple at Logan; for all ordinances would be stopped throughout the land of Zion. Confusion would reign throughout Israel, and many men would be made prisoners. This trouble would have come upon the whole Church, and we should have been compelled to stop the practice. Now, the question is, whether it should be stopped in this manner, or in the way the Lord has manifested to us, and leave our Prophets and Apostles and fathers free men, and the temples in the hands of the people, so that the dead may be redeemed. A large number has already been delivered from the prison house in the spirit world by this people, and shall the work go on or stop? This is the question I lay before the Latter-day Saints. You have to judge for yourselves. I want you to answer it for yourselves. I shall not answer it; but I say to you that that is exactly the condition we as a people would have been in had we not taken the course we have.”

Therefore, the Son of God felt disposed to have that thing presented to the Church and to the world for purposes in his own mind. The Lord had decreed the establishment of Zion. He had decreed the finishing of this temple. He had decreed that the salvation of the living and the dead should be given in these valleys of the mountains. And Almighty God decreed that the Devil should not thwart it. If you can understand that, that is a key to it.”

Birthright

​

Under the patriarchal order, the right or inheritance of the firstborn is known as birthright. This generally included a land inheritance as well as the authority to preside.

From time to time certain prerogatives, opportunities, and blessings have attended those who were born of a particular lineage. Thus the office of high priest (of the Aaronic order) and the office of the patriarch to the Church (in the Melchizedek Priesthood) are hereditary in nature.

4 Therefore, there shall be one day and a night and a day, as if it were one day and there were no night; and this shall be unto you for a sign; for ye shall know of the rising of the sun and also of its setting; therefore they shall know of a surety that there shall be two days and a night; nevertheless the night shall not be darkened; and it shall be the night before he is born.

5 And behold, there shall a new star arise, such an one as ye never have beheld; and this also shall be a sign unto you. (This appears to be a new sun or moon, what is the word for this kind of greater light “star” in the Old Testament?)
