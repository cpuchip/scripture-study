# Section A
## The Hermeneutical Lens
### Temple Sealing as Second Coming Type

*~0:00–19:00 — All verbal, no original slides*

---

## The Bridegroom Is Coming

The temple sealing ordinance testifies of Christ's return.

> "Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready." — Revelation 19:7

> "Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom." — Matthew 25:1

<!--
Verbal-only — no original slide
~1:59: "I would propose that Mormons today, Latter-day Saints, worship the marital ceremony over Christ. Am I wrong?"
-->

---

## The Sons of Levi

> "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord" — Malachi 4:5

> "Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah I confer the Priesthood of Aaron… this shall never be taken again from the earth, until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness." — D&C 13:1

> "Let us present in his holy temple… an offering unto the Lord in righteousness; and let us present… a book containing the records of our dead" — D&C 128:24

<!--
Verbal-only — no original slide
~8:00: "If somebody came along and said, 'Hey, your entire sealing, you exalted your spouse over the Savior'... You told that to a Jew, they'd be like, 'You're crazy. There's no Messiah coming.'"
-->

---

## Lehi's Temple Testimony

> "For it came to pass in the commencement of the first year of the reign of Zedekiah… there came many prophets, prophesying unto the people that they must repent, or the great city Jerusalem must be destroyed." — 1 Nephi 1:4

> "He went forth among the people… to declare unto them concerning the things which he had both seen and heard." — 1 Nephi 1:18–19

Lehi told the Jews their temple testified of the Messiah. They wanted to kill him.

<!--

~8:00–11:00

---

## Four Days of Arguing

> "But behold, there was a day set apart by the unbelievers, that all those who believed in those traditions should be put to death except the sign should come to pass." — 3 Nephi 1:9

How many days are we talking about? There have been four days. What is everybody arguing about in the four days before? Whether or not He's coming.

<!--
Verbal-only — no original slide
~11:26: "How many days are we talking about? There's been four days... What's everybody arguing about in the four days before? Whether or not he's coming."
-->

---

## A Disclaimer

> "Everything I do is not intended to convince you I'm right. I probably am. But it's intended to try to stimulate your mind to think about how to liken the scriptures to us in a very extreme way."

— Morgan Philpot, ~14:30

<!--

This statement establishes the hermeneutical frame for the entire presentation.

## Nelson & Oaks on the Jewish Calendar

- **President Nelson** sustained by solemn assembly on **Passover weekend 2018**
- He passed away during the **Days of Awe** (between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur), **September 2025** — the time of repentance
- **President Oaks** sustained by the Twelve on **Shemini Atzeret** (the "8th day" feast)

The transitions of prophetic leadership align with the Jewish feast calendar.

<!--
Verbal-only — no original slide
~15:00: "President Nelson was sustained by the church in a solemn assembly on Passover weekend in 2018. He passed away in a week between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur known as the time of repentance. President Oaks was sustained by the 12 on Shemini Atzeret."
-->

---

<!-- _class: title -->

# Section B
## The Harvest Framework
### Barley · Wheat · Grapes · Olives

*~19:00–28:00 — Slides 2–38*

---

## Two Dispensations, One Pattern

**Moses** — His dispensation, including symbols and feasts, pointed to the **first coming** of the Lord

**Joseph** — His dispensation, including events, revelations, symbols and appointed times, points to the **Second Coming** of the Lord

<!--
Original slides 2–3
~19:00–20:00: "The restoration of the gospel was of course about ordinances, but it's really about the second coming."
-->

---

## Spring 1820 → Spring 1830

> "It was on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty." — JS-H 1:14

> "The rise of the Church of Christ in these last days… in the fourth month, and on the sixth day of the month which is called April" — D&C 20:1

<!--
Original slides 4–5
-->

---

## Summer Is Now Nigh at Hand

> "Ye look and behold the fig trees… and ye say when they begin to shoot forth, and their leaves are yet tender, that **summer is now nigh at hand**; Even so it shall be in that day when they shall see all these things, then shall they know that **the hour is nigh**." — D&C 45:37–38

<!--
Original slide 6
~24:00: "D&C 45 — summer is now nigh at hand... that's the grape harvest, that's the wrath"
-->

---

## Passover & the Divine Feasts

> "Observe the month of **Abib**, and keep the passover unto the Lord thy God: for in the month of Abib the Lord thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night." — Deuteronomy 16:1

In Hebrew, **Abib** means "green" or "newly ripened ears of grain" (see Leviticus 2:14). It is associated with Spring.

<!--
Original slides 7–9
-->

---

## Passover Week

| Day | Event | Scripture |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| **10** | Lamb brought into household | Exodus 12:3 |
| **14** | Lamb killed in the evening | Exodus 12:5–6 |
| **16** | Wave sheaf — firstfruits offered | Leviticus 23:10–11 |

> "But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the **firstfruits** of them that slept." — 1 Corinthians 15:20

That "sheaf" (omer of barley) was offered on the day after the Sabbath following Passover — the same day Jesus rose from the dead.

<!--
Original slides 10–11, 17–18
-->

---

<!-- _class: scripture -->

## The Fourth Day

> "In the thirty and fourth year, in the first month, **on the fourth day of the month**, there arose a great storm, such an one as never had been known in all the land." — 3 Nephi 8:5

> "The people began to look with great earnestness for the sign which had been given by the prophet Samuel, the Lamanite, yea, for the time that there should be darkness for the space of three days over the face of the land." — 3 Nephi 8:3

<!--
Original slides 13–15
Caveat (slide 16): "We have no way to correctly reckon time" — calendrical systems don't reconcile neatly
-->

---

## The Four Harvests

| Harvest | Season | Feast | Christ's Role | Latter-day Fulfillment |
|---------|--------|-------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Barley** | Early Spring | Passover/Firstfruits | Redeemer / Firstfruits | Resurrection, 33 AD |
| **Wheat** | Late Spring | Pentecost | Lawgiver / Bridegroom | Restoration |
| **Grapes** | Summer | Trumpets/Atonement | Judge / Avenger | Wrath phase |
| **Olives** | Fall | Tabernacles/Ingathering | Anointed King | Adam-ondi-Ahman |

<!--
Original slide 34 — the key summary table
~24:00: "The field is white already to harvest... the Lord is telling Joseph this is the wheat harvest"
-->

---

## Barley — Christ the Firstfruits

The barley harvest represents the first group of the redeemed — those prepared early, sanctified, and offered to God first.

Christ was the literal Barley Sheaf — lifted up before the Father as the accepted firstfruits.

> "For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead." — 1 Corinthians 15:21

<!--
Original slides 17–19
-->

---

## Wheat — The Gathering

> "The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed **tares among the wheat**." — Matthew 13:24–25

> "The field is white already to harvest; and lo, he that thrusteth in his sickle with his might, the same layeth up in store" — D&C 4:4

**1620** — wheat is planted on the promised land
**1820** — the harvest begins

<!--
Original slides 22–26
-->

---

## Grapes — The Judgment Harvest

> "And another angel… thrust in his sharp sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God." — Revelation 14:19

Summer — the vintage of the earth.

<!--
Original slide 27
-->

---

## Olives — The Anointing & Ingathering

> "And the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labors out of the field." — Exodus 23:16

The olive oil was the crown of the harvest — the essence extracted through pressing — and the token of kingship, light, and peace.

**Adam-ondi-Ahman** — where "the keys of all dispensations will be returned to the Son of Man."

> "It shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the **feast of tabernacles**." — Zechariah 14:16

## The Fourfold Parallel

| | Creation | Holy Week | 7000 Years | 7 Seals |
|--|----------|-----------|------------|---------|
| **1** | Light/dark | Triumphal entry | Adam–Enoch | 1st seal |
| **2** | Waters divided | Teaching | Enoch–Noah | 2nd seal |
| **3** | Dry land, plants | Teaching | Noah–Abraham | 3rd seal |
| **4** | Sun, moon, stars | **Crucifixion** | Abraham–Christ | 4th seal |
| **5** | Sea creatures | — | Dark Ages | 5th seal |
| **6** | Land animals, man | — | Restoration | 6th seal |
| **7** | REST | REST | Millennium | 7th seal |

# Section C
## Revelation 12
### The Woman, Child & Dragon

*~28:30–42:00 — Slides 121–148*

---

## The Restoration in Revelation 12

> "And there appeared a great sign in heaven, **in the likeness of things on the earth**; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars." — JST Revelation 12:1

John picks up right where Nephi left off.

"In the likeness of things on the earth" — this JST phrase means Revelation 12 is *meant* to have both a heavenly and an earthly fulfillment.

<!--
Original slides 121–122
~28:30–29:00
-->

---

## The Woman = The Church of God

> "The woman which was **the church of God**, who had been delivered of her pains, and brought forth **the kingdom of our God and his Christ**." — JST Revelation 12:7

The JST makes explicit what the KJV leaves symbolic.

<!--
Original slide 123
-->

---

## The Church Organized (April 6, 1830)

> "The rise of the Church of Christ in these last days… in the fourth month, and on the sixth day of the month which is called April" — D&C 20:1

- Tuesday, April 6, 1830
- Wednesday, April 7, 1830 is believed to have been Jewish Passover

<!--
Original slide 124
-->

---

## The Man Child = The Kingdom of God

> "She brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up unto God and his throne." — JST Revelation 12:3

**March 11, 1844** — The Council of Fifty organized

> "In this Council was President Joseph Smith chosen our Prophet, Priest, and King by Hosannas."
> — William Clayton Journal, 153–154

<!--
Original slides 125–126
~29:30, ~36:00
-->

---

## Karl Marx — 1844

In this same pivotal year, Karl Marx published the *Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844*, laying groundwork for an alternative kingdom that would compete with God's kingdom for the next two centuries.

A counterfeit prophet in the same year as the true Kingdom's organization.

<!--
Verbal-only — no original slide
~31:00: Transcript only. Philpot draws the Marx/1844 parallel.
-->

---

## The Twelve Stars

> "Upon her head a crown of twelve stars" — JST Revelation 12:1

**February 8, 1835** — Joseph Smith received revelation to call the Twelve Apostles.

Of the original twelve, **four permanently left** — the "third part of the stars" drawn away by the dragon's tail.

- Lyman Johnson — Apostatized, Excommunicated
- William E. McLellin — Apostatized, Excommunicated
- John F. Boynton — Apostatized, Excommunicated
- Thomas B. Marsh — Excommunicated (later rebaptized)

<!--
Original slides 128–132
~30:00
-->

---

## Michael and Adam

> "Michael is to our spirits what Adam is to our bodies."

A distinction between the premortal leader (Michael, who fought in the War in Heaven) and the mortal steward (Adam, who received the earth).

<!--
Verbal-only — no original slide
~34:39. Creative but speculative.
-->

---

## The Prophet Martyred (June 27, 1844)

> "To seal the testimony of this book and the Book of Mormon, we announce the martyrdom of Joseph Smith the Prophet… shot in Carthage jail… by an armed mob—painted black." — D&C 135:1

> "Their innocent blood on the banner of liberty, and… under the altar that John saw, will cry unto the Lord of Hosts till **he avenges that blood on the earth**." — D&C 135:7

The child "caught up unto God and his throne."

<!--
Original slides 139–140
~33:00

---

## Daniel 2 — A Kingdom Set Up

> "In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven **set up a kingdom**, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms." — Daniel 2:44

On March 11, 1844, Joseph Smith organized the Council of Fifty — seen by him and his associates as the beginning of the literal kingdom of God on earth.

<!--
Original slides 134–137
~43:00
-->

---

## The Woman Flees to the Wilderness (1846–47)

> "To the woman were given **two wings of a great eagle**, that she might flee into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for **a time, and times, and half a time**, from the face of the serpent." — JST Revelation 12:14

The pioneer exodus — the Church received permission from the US government (the eagle) to flee west.

<!--
Original slides 142–144
~33:00, ~36:00

## Joseph's Territorial Vision

Joseph envisioned the Saints occupying Arizona, Utah, Idaho — a full intended territory, compared to the Israelites who settled for partial conquest.

<!--

## The Jubilee Cycle

> "Ye shall hallow the **fiftieth year**… it shall be a **jubilee** unto you" — Leviticus 25:10

| Unit | Jubilee Years |
|------|---:|
| A time | 50 |
| Times | 100 |
| Half a time | 25 |
| **Total** | **175** |

**1847 + 175 = 2022**

The claimed expiration of the nourishment period.

<!--
Original slide 147
~37:00
Note: 1897 Conference Report — Elder Anthon: "This has been our Jubilee year, fifty years since we arrived in these mountains"
-->

---

## After 2022 — The Dragon Makes War

> "The dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the **remnant of her seed**, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ." — Revelation 12:17

> "It was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to **overcome them**: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations." — Revelation 13:7

If the protection came off, what would that look like?

# Section D
## The Beast of Revelation 13
### Identifying the United States

*~42:00–1:24:00 — Almost entirely verbal-only*
*Replaces the slide-based Ezekiel 17 material*

<!--
Evaluation: See 05a_revelation_13.md for full assessment of 18 key claims.
Summary: 6 In Line, 3 Nuanced, 5 Out of Line, 3 Missed the Mark.
Key finding: Beast ≠ devil distinction is textually sound, but 42-month math is wrong
and Daniel 2 toes→presidents is eisegesis.
-->

---

## The Beast Rises from the Sea

> "And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy." — Revelation 13:1

> "In the likeness of the kingdoms of the earth." — JST Revelation 13:1

The beast is not the devil — it is a **government**.

<!--
Verbal-only — no original slide
~42:00–43:00: The verbal Phase 5 begins. This content completely replaces the Ezekiel 17 material on the slides.
~1:18:00: "Beast = government, NOT devil" (explicit clarification)
-->

---

## Daniel 2 — Toes to Presidents

The ten toes of Daniel's image represent the presidents from George Washington through the organization of the Kingdom of God on March 11, 1844.

> "As the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken." — Daniel 2:42

<!--
Verbal-only — no original slide
~43:00–45:00
-->

---

## Cain & Abel — Temple Authority

The first murder was at the altar — a dispute over authority in worship. Government power and religious authority have been intertwined since Genesis 4.

> "The little serpent becomes the huge dragon" — the growth of oppressive government power from small beginnings.

<!--
Verbal-only — no original slide
~45:00–46:00
-->

---

## Hamilton & Central Banking

Alexander Hamilton established the first national bank, beginning the financial architecture that would become the beast's economic power.

- War of 1812 — British attack partly over banking
- Andrew Jackson — destroyed the Second Bank
- South + Mormons — commodity economies vs. industrial/banking North

<!--
Verbal-only — no original slide
~49:00–53:00
-->

---

## "Twin Relics of Barbarism" (1856)

The 1856 Republican Party platform named **slavery and polygamy** as the "twin relics of barbarism" to be eradicated.

After abolishing slavery, the government turned its full attention to the Saints.

<!--
Verbal-only — no original slide
~53:46. Historically accurate.
-->

---

## Edmunds-Tucker Act (1887)

> "The house of Representatives of the Congress of the United States has this day turned the Last key that seals their Condemnation and lays the foundation for the overthrow & final destruction of the United States government."
> — Wilford Woodruff's Journal, 1887

The Act criminalized the brethren, dissolved the Church corporation, seized Church property, and disenfranchised women.

<!--
Original slides 176–178 (overlap: on slides AND verbal)
~58:00
-->

---

## Official Declaration 1 (1890/1893)

> "The Lord showed me by vision and revelation exactly what would take place if we did not stop this practice… all ordinances would be stopped throughout the land of Zion."
> — Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake Temple Dedication

> "The Son of God felt disposed to have that thing presented to the Church and to the world for purposes in his own mind… And Almighty God decreed that **the Devil should not thwart it**."

Strategic obedience to preserve temples, ordinances, and prophetic liberty.

<!--
Original slides 179–180
-->

---

## Birthright Forfeited

Under the Utah Statehood conditions (1896), the Saints permanently surrendered:

| Birthright Element | Forfeited |
|-------------------|-----------|
| **Land** | "Forever disclaim all right and title to unappropriated public lands" |
| **Priesthood practice** | "Polygamous or plural marriages are forever prohibited" |
| **Religious education** | Public schools "free from sectarian control" |
| **Posterity** | Family structure redefined by government |

> "That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up" — Ezekiel 17:14

<!--
Original slides 183–185
~1:02:00
-->

---

## The Blood Oath

> "Their innocent blood on the banner of liberty" — D&C 135:7

Joseph Smith was murdered. Nothing happened to the killers. A "blood oath between the devil and the United States" — the government took the life of a prophet and was never held accountable.

<!--
Verbal-only — no original slide
~1:03:00
-->

---

## Seven Heads = Seven Dispensational Beasts

The seven heads of the beast represent seven world powers across the dispensations. The seventh beast — the final iteration — is "perfected," carrying all the powers of its predecessors.

> "The beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion." — Revelation 13:2

It has all prior powers combined.

<!--
Verbal-only — no original slide
~1:04:00–1:06:00
-->

---

## The Deadly Wound Healed

> "I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed." — Revelation 13:3

**The Civil War** — the nation nearly died and was reconstituted.

The **42 months** claim: from the Emancipation Proclamation to Lee's surrender.

*(Note: Jan 1, 1863 → April 9, 1865 = ~27 months, not 42. The math appears incorrect.)*

<!--

## War with the Saints

> "And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them." — Revelation 13:7

After the Civil War, the reconstituted government turned against the Saints with full force — Edmunds-Tucker, the Raid, statehood conditions.

<!--

~1:07:00–1:09:00

## Ten Horns = Ten Post-Lincoln Presidents

The ten horns represent the first ten presidents after Lincoln (Andrew Johnson through William Taft), during which the government's power over the Church intensified.

<!--

## The 1907 Church Declaration

Philpot references the 1907 Church declaration with its conditional loyalty language.

<!--

---

## Two-Horned Beast = the Two-Party System

> "And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon." — Revelation 13:11

**Woodrow Wilson / Warren Harding** — the emergence of the modern Republican/Democrat duopoly as a unified power structure that speaks as a dragon while appearing lamb-like.

## "Fire from Heaven"

> "And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men." — Revelation 13:13

**Nuclear weapons** — Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The United States literally brought fire from heaven.

<!--

## Image of the Beast

> "And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed." — Revelation 13:15

The **intelligence community and propaganda apparatus** — the image that speaks and demands allegiance.

<!--

## The Mark of the Beast

> "And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark." — Revelation 13:16–17

The **financial and monetary system** — participation in the economy requires compliance with the beast's system.
