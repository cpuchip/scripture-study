## Presenter Background

Morgan Philpot is a constitutional attorney, former Utah state legislator, and member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The user notes that lawyers like Philpot, Matt Jeppson, and David Butler bring a capacity to "digest the nuances of the scriptures" through their analytical training. This presentation was given at a fireside-type event in Chandler, Arizona in 2025.

## Study Approach

This study follows the **Video Evaluation workflow** from our [copilot instructions](../../../.github/copilot-instructions.md):

1. **Discovery → Deep Reading → Writing** rhythm for each phase
2. **Cite count rule:** For every source cited, `read_file` the actual source
3. **Two-phase verification:** Search tools find *what* to study; `read_file` is how we *actually study it*
4. **Webster 1828** for historical word meanings where relevant
5. **Honest evaluation:** In Line / Out of Line / Missed the Mark / Missed Opportunities

Each phase produces its own study document following the [yt_evaluation_template.md](../../../docs/yt_evaluation_template.md), adapted for a multi-part study rather than a single video evaluation.

## A Note on Training Biases

The user wisely flagged that this presentation will brush against AI training biases. Areas where I should be transparent:

1. **End-times interpretation:** AI models are trained to be cautious about eschatological date-setting. Philpot provides specific dates and parallels. I should evaluate these against scripture honestly rather than reflexively dismissing them as "speculation."

2. **Political mapping:** Mapping modern political figures to Book of Mormon characters (e.g., Trump = Lachoneus) can trigger political-safety responses. I should evaluate the *scriptural reasoning* behind the mapping rather than the political conclusion.

3. **Apocrypha use:** Philpot draws heavily from 2 Esdras (Ezra's Eagle). D&C 91 provides actual revelation about the Apocrypha — that's the standard to use, not modern scholarly dismissal.

4. **Institutional critique:** Some claims about the Church ("corporate church") may trigger pro-institution bias. Evaluate against scripture and prophetic statements, not institutional loyalty.

5. **Future projections:** Specific predictions (2029 assassination, 2033 destruction) are the most speculative claims. These deserve honest evaluation — neither dismissed nor endorsed — against what scripture actually says.

**My commitment:** When I notice I'm hedging unnaturally or adding unnecessary disclaimers, I'll flag it as a potential bias response. The scriptures are the standard, not my training data.

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation & the Harvest Framework
**Slides:** 2–38 | **Transcript:** Part I ~0:00–19:00 | **Output:** [01_foundation.md](01_foundation.md)

**Content:**
- Dispensation framing: Moses → Joseph Smith, Spring 1820/1830
- Passover symbolism: Abib, day 14, day 4 of Passover week ↔ 3 Nephi 8
- Harvest typology: barley (Passover) → wheat (Pentecost) → grapes (Trumpets/Atonement) → olives (Tabernacles)
- Creation days ↔ Holy Week ↔ 7000-year plan ↔ 7 seals
- D&C 4 "the field is white" / D&C 45 "summer harvest"

**Key Scriptures to Verify:**
- Leviticus 23 (appointed feasts)
- Deuteronomy 16 (three pilgrimage feasts)
- D&C 4 (field is white)
- D&C 45 (summer / signs)
- Revelation 5–8 (seven seals)

**Evaluation Focus:** Is the harvest-to-feast typology scripturally sound? Do the creation/holy week/seal parallels hold up under scrutiny, or is this pattern-matching?

---

### Phase 2: Signs of the Times & Prophetic Warnings
**Slides:** 40–92 | **Transcript:** Part I ~19:00–34:00 | **Output:** [02_signs_and_warnings.md](02_signs_and_warnings.md)

**Content:**
- 1 Nephi 19:23 — the "likening" principle as hermeneutic key
- President Nelson's warnings (2018–2022): "front-row seats," "perilous times"
- 1 Nephi 14: Two churches only (Whore of All Earth vs. Church of the Lamb)
- Signs of His coming: Matthew 24 / Mark 13 / Luke 21 comparison
- D&C 88:87-95 wrath sequence
- Jacob & the Latter-day Gentiles (2 Nephi 6, 3 Nephi 16/20/21)
- Parables of Mark 4, Peter's admonition (2 Peter 3)
- Walk to Emmaus, Woman at the Well
- D&C 121:26-32 — "nothing withheld" in the dispensation of the fulness of times

**Key Scriptures to Verify:**
- 1 Nephi 14 (two churches)
- Matthew 24 / JST Matthew 1
- D&C 88:87-95 (wrath sequence)
- 2 Nephi 6 (Jacob's prophecy of Gentiles)
- 3 Nephi 16, 20, 21 (Christ's Gentile warnings)
- D&C 121:26-32

**Evaluation Focus:** Are the Nelson quotes in context? Does the "likening" hermeneutic have limits, and does Philpot respect them? Is the two-churches reading of 1 Nephi 14 accurate?

---

### Phase 3: The Grand Apocalyptic Vision & the Return
**Slides:** 93–120 | **Transcript:** Part I ~34:00–42:00 | **Output:** [03_apocalyptic_vision.md](03_apocalyptic_vision.md)

**Content:**
- The "Grand Apocalyptic Vision" thread: Amos 3:7, Daniel 2:28, Revelation 10:7, Colossians 1:26
- Start with Moses: Deuteronomy 29–30 (covenant, blessing/curse, return)
- 1620 Pilgrims → Gentiles "established & set up" (3 Nephi 21:4, 1 Nephi 13)
- The Constitution as patriarchal instrument: preside/provide/protect (Family Proclamation)
- The power of the fathers (Dallin H. Oaks quote)
- Deuteronomy 28 blessings → 1 Nephi 13:30 (nation "above all other nations")
- Restoration timeline: September 1823 (Feast of Tabernacles), September 1827 (Rosh Hashanah)
- 1 Nephi 14:25-27 — Nephi hands off to John

**Key Scriptures to Verify:**
- Deuteronomy 29–30 (the covenant)
- 3 Nephi 21:4 (why Gentiles are established)
- 1 Nephi 13:6, 30 (Gentile nation)
- 1 Nephi 14:25-27 (Nephi → John transition)
- D&C 20:1 (Church organization date)

**Evaluation Focus:** Is the Deuteronomy 29–30 framework legitimate for latter-day application? Does the Constitution-as-patriarchal-order reading hold up? Are the Jewish calendar connections (Feast of Tabernacles 1823, Rosh Hashanah 1827) historically accurate?

---

### Phase 4: Revelation 12 — The Woman, Child & Dragon
**Slides:** 121–148 | **Transcript:** Part I ~42:00–1:00:00 | **Output:** [04_revelation_12.md](04_revelation_12.md)

**Content:**
- JST Revelation 12 — John picks up where Nephi left off
- The Woman = the Church of God (JST Rev 12:7)
- Church organized April 6, 1830 (Jewish Passover April 7, 1830?)
- The Child = Council of Fifty / Kingdom of God (March 11, 1844)
- William Clayton journal: Joseph Smith as "Prophet, Priest, and King"
- The Dragon (JST Rev 12:4) — seven heads, ten horns
- Third part of stars = original Twelve Apostles (D&C 112:30) — 8 of 12 fell away
- Joseph martyred June 27, 1844 — "child caught up unto God"
- D&C 135 — the testimony sealed
- Woman flees to wilderness (1846–1847 pioneer exodus)
- Jubilee cycle interpretation: time = 50, times = 100, half a time = 25 → 175 years
- 1847 + 175 = 2022 — claimed expiration of the nourishment period
- Revelation 12:17 / 13:6 — dragon makes war with remnant after nourishment ends

**Key Scriptures to Verify:**
- JST Revelation 12 (full chapter)
- D&C 20:1 (Church organization)
- D&C 112:30 (Twelve in last days)
- D&C 135 (martyrdom)
- Leviticus 25:2, 10 (jubilee)
- Revelation 13:6-7

**Evaluation Focus:** Is the Council of Fifty = "man child" interpretation supportable from JST Revelation 12? Is the jubilee cycle math (time/times/half = 50+100+25 = 175) standard biblical interpretation or novel? The 2022 endpoint is a testable claim — what has happened since?

**Bias alert:** The Council of Fifty and "Prophet, Priest, and King" material draws from historical sources outside the standard works. I should evaluate this on the merits of the JST text and historical record, not on whether it fits comfortable narratives.

### Phase 5: Ezekiel's Eagle & the Rebellious House
**Slides:** 149–186 | **Transcript:** Part I ~1:00:00–1:24:00 | **Output:** [05_ezekiels_eagle.md](05_ezekiels_eagle.md)

**Content:**
- Revelation 12:14 — "two wings of a great eagle" → transition to Ezekiel 17
- Ezekiel 17 riddle: great eagle, divers colours (cf. Joseph's coat, Genesis 37:3)
- The highest branch = Joseph Smith (2 Nephi 3:5, 15)
- Land of traffick = Canaan/Commerce, Illinois (Hebrew kə·nā·'an)
- City of merchants = Nauvoo (D&C 124)
- Second great eagle (Ezekiel 17:7) — the US government?
- East wind = famine/judgment (Genesis 41, Hinckley October 2001)
- The rebellious house: Alfred Cumming appointed governor (1858)
- Edmunds-Tucker Act (1887) — Wilford Woodruff's journal
- Official Declaration 1 (1890/1893) — Woodruff's explanation
- Utah statehood conditions (1896) — "that the kingdom might be base"
- "Political domination" quote from Senator Dubois
- Broken oaths and covenants (Ezekiel 17:15-19)
- Birthright and hereditary priesthood (Bible Dictionary)

**Key Scriptures to Verify:**
- Ezekiel 17 (full chapter)
- 2 Nephi 3:5, 15 (Joseph's branch)
- Genesis 37:3 (coat of many colours)
- D&C 124 (Nauvoo revelation)
- Leviticus 25 (jubilee / land sabbath)
- Moses 6:14-17 (land of Cainan)
- Genesis 41 (Pharaoh's dream, east wind)

**Evaluation Focus:** Is Ezekiel 17 legitimately applicable to Restoration history, or is this eisegesis? The Hebrew word study (kə·nā·'an = land of traffick = Commerce, IL) is the kind of claim that needs careful verification. How does D&C 91 frame the use of Apocrypha for the Esdras material introduced at the end of this section?

---

### Phase 6: Esdras, Daniel & the Appointed Times
**Slides:** 187–228 | **Transcript:** Part II ~0:00–30:00 | **Output:** [06_esdras_and_appointed_times.md](06_esdras_and_appointed_times.md)

**Content:**
- D&C 91 on the Apocrypha — "whoso is enlightened by the Spirit shall obtain benefit"
- 2 Esdras 11 — Ezra's Eagle (the eagle with feathers mapped to US presidents)
- Daniel 7 — the fourth beast
- Moroni's scripture recitation to Joseph Smith (JSH 1:30-41)
- Joel 2:28-32 (wonders, blood, fire, pillars of smoke)
- President Hinckley October 2001 — "Living in the Fulness of Times" / "The Times in Which We Live"
- Ether 8:23-24 — wakeup call about secret combinations
- Samuel the Lamanite — sword of justice (Helaman 13)
- Signs, Seasons, Appointed Times: Genesis 1:14 (mō·w·'ă·ḏîm), Leviticus 23 (feasts as appointed times), D&C 88:42-49 (heavenly bodies as kingdom witnesses)
- Palmyra Temple dedication astronomy: planetary alignment April 5-6, 2000
- Hebrew Mazzaroth names, zodiac-to-Hebrew-month mapping
- Psalms 19 — "The heavens declare the glory of God"

**Key Scriptures to Verify:**
- D&C 91 (Apocrypha guidance)
- JSH 1:30-41 (Moroni's recitation)
- Joel 2:28-32
- Ether 8:23-24
- Helaman 13 (Samuel the Lamanite)
- Genesis 1:14 (Hebrew word study)
- Leviticus 23 (feasts)
- D&C 88:42-49, 87-95
- Psalms 19

**Evaluation Focus:** Does D&C 91 actually support the way Philpot uses 2 Esdras, or does it caution more than endorse? Is the Hebrew word study (mō·w·'ă·ḏîm = feasts = appointed times) accurate? The astronomical claims about April 5-6, 2000 are verifiable — are they correct?

**Bias alert:** 2 Esdras / Ezra's Eagle is probably the section most likely to trigger "fringe" classification in my training. D&C 91 is the Latter-day Saint standard for evaluating Apocryphal material. I should use D&C 91, not academic consensus, as my framework.

---

### Phase 7: The Type & Sign — 9/11 and Year-by-Year Parallels
**Slides:** 229–268 | **Transcript:** Part II ~30:00–55:00 | **Output:** [07_type_and_sign.md](07_type_and_sign.md)

**Content:**
- D&C 88:87-95 continued — the wrath sequence after the Palmyra sign
- D&C 88:93-95 — "great sign in heaven," "mother of abominations," "silence in heaven"
- Revelation 17–18 — the judgment of the great whore
- Revelation 18:4 — "Come out of her, my people"
- 9/11 as type/sign: "in one hour" (Rev 18:10), merchants (Rev 18:11), ships (Rev 18:17), "twofold" (Rev 18:6 → diplōsate / dipla)
- BoM-Modern year-by-year parallels (Years 92–118 / 2000–2017):
  - Year 92/2000: Sign given (Palmyra / 3 Nephi 1)
  - Year 93/2001: Gadianton robbers on the mountains (3 Nephi 1:27 / 9/11)
  - Year 95/2004: People forget the signs (3 Nephi 2:1-3)
  - Year 100/2009: Years of Mosiah complete (3 Nephi 2:5)
  - Year 113/2012: Wars and contentions (3 Nephi 2:11 / Obama second term)
  - Year 116/2015: Same-sex marriage ruling, Monson's repentance plea
  - Year 117/2016: Lachoneus epistle (3 Nephi 3:1)
  - Year 118/2017: Robbers "take possession of the lands" (3 Nephi 4:1), debt/GDP > 100%, 2017 eclipse
- Pharmakeia: Strong's 5331, Revelation 18:23 (sorceries = drug-related deception)
- Webster 1828: sorcery / pharmacology
- Isaiah 8:19 — familiar spirits, wizards

**Key Scriptures to Verify:**
- Revelation 17–18 (full chapters)
- 3 Nephi 1:26-30, 2:1-12, 3:1-25, 4:1
- D&C 88:93-95
- Isaiah 8:19-22
- 3 Nephi 23:1-3 (Christ commands to search Isaiah)

**Key Timeline References:**
- [timeline.md](../../../yt/morganphilpot/timeline.md) years 92–118

**Evaluation Focus:** This is the core interpretive claim — that the Book of Mormon's Nephite timeline from the sign of Christ's birth maps year-by-year to events starting in 2000. Is the pattern genuine or cherry-picked? Do the 3 Nephi descriptions genuinely match modern events, or is this confirmation bias? The pharmakeia word study is straightforward Greek — verify the Strong's number and usage.

**Bias alert:** This section combines political interpretation with eschatological claims. I should evaluate the *scriptural parallels* on their merits and flag where the modern mapping requires interpretive leaps vs. where it naturally aligns.

### Phase 8: Isaiah's Harbinger, the Hinge Point & Types of Judah
**Slides:** 269–355 | **Transcript:** Part II ~55:00–1:11:00, Part III ~0:00–25:00 | **Output:** [08_harbinger_and_hinge.md](08_harbinger_and_hinge.md)

**Content:**
- D&C 89:4 — "conspiring men in the last days" (Word of Wisdom context)
- Isaiah 9–10 harbinger pattern:
  - Isaiah 9:10 quoted on US Senate floor after 9/11 (Tom Daschle, Sept 12, 2001)
  - "Bricks fallen / hewn stones" as defiance pattern
  - 24-year framework (744–721 BC ↔ 2001–2025?)
  - Adversaries of Rezin, Assyria as "rod of God's anger"
- Palmyra/Jericho connection: City of Palm Trees (Deut 34:3, Judges 1:16, 2 Kings 2)
  - Elisha's healing of Jericho's waters
  - Good Samaritan: "went down from Jerusalem to Jericho" (Luke 10:30)
  - Day before Palm Sunday: Mark 10:46 (out of Jericho)
  - Triumphal Entry with palm branches (Matthew 21, John 12:13)
- Sixth Seal & Palmyra: Revelation 6:12-17
- D&C 110 (Lord appears in Kirtland Temple) ↔ Revelation 6:14 (scroll rolled together)
- D&C 124:45 — "they shall not be moved out of their place"
- Seventh Seal calculation: 1000 years / 24 hours = 41.67 per hour, ÷ 2 = 20.8 years
  - April 2000 + 20.8 years ≈ October 2020 (!)
- COVID hinge point (March 2020):
  - Nelson "hinge point" quote from Rome Temple dedication (March 15, 2019)
  - Day-by-day timeline: March 5–18, 2020 (temple closures → church closures → national emergency)
  - D&C 112:24-25 — "upon my house shall it begin"
  - Salt Lake earthquake March 18, 2020
  - Bicentennial Proclamation April 2020
- Southern Kingdom of Judah → Utah governors (20 kings mapped to 20 governors, 1896–present)
- Jeremiah 4:5-7 — "Assemble yourselves... blow ye the trumpet"

**Key Scriptures to Verify:**
- Isaiah 9–10
- D&C 89:4
- Deuteronomy 34:3 (city of palm trees)
- Luke 10:30 (Good Samaritan)
- Matthew 21 / John 12:13 (Triumphal Entry)
- Revelation 6:12-17
- D&C 110, D&C 124:45
- D&C 112:24-25
- D&C 38:11-12

**Evaluation Focus:** The "half hour of silence" = 20.8 years calculation is a specific, testable claim. Is this math consistent with how other prophets and scholars have read it? The COVID/D&C 112 connection is striking — does it hold up in D&C 112's full context? The Judah–Utah governor mapping needs careful evaluation: is this typology or forced parallelism?

---

### Phase 9: The Two Great Lights & Culmination
**Slides:** 356–369 + Part III extended (25:00–1:00:00) | **Output:** [09_culmination.md](09_culmination.md)

**Content:**
- Helaman 14:1-5 — Samuel's signs of Christ's coming
  - "Two great lights" / "new star" — Hebrew Kokaubeam (Abraham 3:13, 16)
  - Numbers 24:17 — Star out of Jacob (kō·w·ḵāḇ)
  - Second Coming chiasmus foreshadowing
- Isaiah 13:6-13 — Day of the Lord
- Eclipse interpretation: 2017 and 2024 total solar eclipses over US
- Future projections from timeline (2025–2033):
  - Year 120/2028: Contentious election
  - Year 121/2029: Assassination / succession crisis
  - Year 125/2033: Great destruction / 3 Nephi 8
  - Christ visits Bountiful
- Grape harvest of Revelation 14 — wrath/treading
- Olive harvest — Adam-ondi-Ahman ([D&C 116](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/116.md))
- New Jerusalem (Ether 13)
- Joseph Smith as type of Joseph who was sold into Egypt
- Temple ceremony symbolism (brief, no details exposed)
- Preparation urgency: physical and spiritual readiness

**Key Scriptures to Verify:**
- Helaman 14:1-5
- Abraham 3:13, 16
- Numbers 24:17
- Isaiah 13:6-13
- Revelation 14 (grape harvest)
- D&C 116 (Adam-ondi-Ahman)
- Ether 13 (New Jerusalem)
- 3 Nephi 8 (destruction)

**Evaluation Focus:** The future projections are the most speculative portion. Distinguish between what the scriptures actually say about the events preceding Christ's coming vs. what requires Philpot's specific timeline framework. The Hebrew word studies (Kokaubeam, kō·w·ḵāḇ) should be verified. What do the scriptures *actually* promise about timing vs. what Philpot reads into them?

**Bias alert:** End-times date-setting is where my training biases will be strongest. I should let scripture speak — D&C 49:7 says "the hour and the day no man knoweth," but that doesn't mean God hasn't given patterns and signs. Both principles are true simultaneously.

---

## Cross-Cutting Themes to Track

These themes recur across multiple phases. As we study each phase, note evidence for/against:

1. **The "likening" hermeneutic** — How far can 1 Nephi 19:23 stretch? Where does legitimate typology end and eisegesis begin?
2. **Hebrew calendar connections** — Are the feast-day alignments (Passover 1830, Tabernacles 1823, Rosh Hashanah 1827, Palmyra 2000) historically verified?
3. **The two-timeline claim** — Is the Nephite year-by-year parallel to modern events a genuine pattern or confirmation bias?
4. **D&C 91 and the Apocrypha** — How much interpretive weight should we give 2 Esdras?
5. **Prophetic authority** — Does Philpot cross lines between studying prophecy and making prophecy?
6. **Physical preparation vs. spiritual preparation** — What emphasis does scripture give to each?
7. **The corporate church critique** — Is this a legitimate concern or an anti-institutional stance?
