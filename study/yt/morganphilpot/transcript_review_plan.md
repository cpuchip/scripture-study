# Transcript Review Plan

A systematic re-review of all three video transcripts against the nine completed phase evaluations, ensuring Philpot's *verbal* arguments — not just his slides — are faithfully captured.

> *"But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief."* — [1 Thessalonians 5:4](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/1-thes/5.md)

## Why This Review

The nine phase evaluations were written primarily from the **slides** ([slides.md](../../../yt/morganphilpot/slides.md)) with supporting transcript reads. But slides are scaffolding — the real argument lives in what Philpot *says*. A presenter of his caliber will:

- Explain nuances that aren't on the slide
- Tell stories and anecdotes that illustrate his points
- Make verbal connections between scriptures that the slides only list
- Respond to the audience's energy and add off-script material
- State his strongest claims in speech, not on a bullet point

This review ensures we didn't miss anything that changes an evaluation — "In Line" arguments we didn't catch, "Out of Line" claims we overlooked, or nuances that shift something from one category to another.

## Method

For each review pass:

1. **Load** the transcript section (by timestamp range from study_plans.md)
2. **Load** the corresponding phase evaluation document
3. **Read** the transcript carefully, noting:
   - Verbal arguments not present on slides
   - Stories, anecdotes, or personal experiences
   - Scripture citations spoken but not on slides
   - Claims stated more forcefully (or more carefully) than the slide suggests
   - Audience interaction or off-script moments
   - Tone and emphasis that changes the meaning
4. **Compare** against the evaluation: Did we capture this? Did we evaluate it fairly?
5. **Document** findings in the "Findings" section below
6. **Update** the phase evaluation if warranted (add new sections, adjust ratings, note missed content)

## Review Schedule

### Part I Transcript — Phases 1–5

Part I covers the most ground: five full phases in 1:24. The transcript is the longest (~68 KB) and the slide density is highest here.

#### Pass 1: Phase 1 — Foundation & Harvest Framework
- **Transcript:** Part I ~0:00–19:00
- **Slides:** 2–38
- **Evaluation:** [01_foundation.md](01_foundation.md)
- **Review focus:** The harvest typology verbal explanation — does Philpot elaborate on the creation-day / holy-week / 7000-year / 7-seal parallel in ways the slides don't capture? Any personal testimony or anecdotes about how he arrived at this framework?

#### Pass 2: Phase 2 — Signs & Prophetic Warnings
- **Transcript:** Part I ~19:00–34:00
- **Slides:** 40–92
- **Evaluation:** [02_signs_and_warnings.md](02_signs_and_warnings.md)
- **Review focus:** This is a dense slide section (52 slides in 15 minutes). The verbal delivery likely moves fast. Watch for: Nelson quote context, the "likening" hermeneutic argument, 1 Nephi 14 verbal explanation, any D&C 121:26-32 elaboration that isn't on the slides.

#### Pass 3: Phase 3 — Grand Apocalyptic Vision
- **Transcript:** Part I ~34:00–42:00
- **Slides:** 93–120
- **Evaluation:** [03_apocalyptic_vision.md](03_apocalyptic_vision.md)
- **Review focus:** The Deuteronomy 29–30 covenant framework, Constitution as patriarchal instrument, and the 1 Nephi 13 → 3 Nephi 21 Gentile thread. Only 8 minutes for 27 slides — he may be reading scripture aloud rather than adding commentary. Or he may pack verbal arguments between slides.

#### Pass 4: Phase 4 — Revelation 12
- **Transcript:** Part I ~42:00–1:00:00
- **Slides:** 121–148
- **Evaluation:** [04_revelation_12.md](04_revelation_12.md)
- **Review focus:** The most historically dense section. The Council of Fifty = "man child" argument, the William Clayton journal references, the jubilee math (50+100+25=175). Philpot likely explains the historical reasoning verbally in ways the slides can't. This is the longest single-phase segment in Part I (18 minutes).

#### Pass 5: Phase 5 — Ezekiel's Eagle
- **Transcript:** Part I ~1:00:00–1:24:00
- **Slides:** 149–186
- **Evaluation:** [05_ezekiels_eagle.md](05_ezekiels_eagle.md)
- **Review focus:** The Ezekiel 17 riddle, Hebrew word study (kə·nā·'an), Edmunds-Tucker history, and the "rebellious house" argument. Nearly 24 minutes — the longest Part I segment. Philpot may narrate historical events with more detail than the slides show. Also the transition into 2 Esdras that sets up Phase 6.

---

### Part II Transcript — Phases 6–8a

Part II covers three phases in 1:11. The transcript is ~54 KB.

#### Pass 6: Phase 6 — Esdras, Daniel & Appointed Times
- **Transcript:** Part II ~0:00–30:00
- **Slides:** 187–228
- **Evaluation:** [06_esdras_and_appointed_times.md](06_esdras_and_appointed_times.md)
- **Review focus:** D&C 91 framing of Apocrypha, the Ezra's Eagle feather-to-president mapping (verbal specifics), the Hebrew word study (mō·w·'ă·ḏîm), and the Palmyra Temple astronomical claims. Half of Part II — this is where Philpot likely takes the most time explaining the controversial Esdras material.

#### Pass 7: Phase 7 — The Type & Sign
- **Transcript:** Part II ~30:00–55:00
- **Slides:** 229–268
- **Evaluation:** [07_type_and_sign.md](07_type_and_sign.md)
- **Review focus:** The year-by-year BoM-modern parallels, the 9/11 = Revelation 18 argument, and the pharmakeia word study. This is the heart of the "two-timeline" interpretive claim. Philpot's verbal explanations of the year-by-year mapping will be more detailed than the slide bullets. 25 minutes for 39 slides.

#### Pass 8: Phase 8a — Isaiah's Harbinger (Part II portion)
- **Transcript:** Part II ~55:00–1:11:00
- **Slides:** 269–310 (approx)
- **Evaluation:** [08_harbinger_and_hinge.md](08_harbinger_and_hinge.md)
- **Review focus:** Isaiah 9–10 harbinger pattern, the Palmyra/Jericho connection, and the beginning of the COVID hinge-point argument. Part II ends mid-Phase 8 — note where the break falls.

---

### Part III Transcript — Phases 8b–9

Part III covers the end of Phase 8 and all of Phase 9 in 1:00. The transcript is ~46 KB.

#### Pass 9: Phase 8b — The Hinge Point & Types of Judah (Part III portion)
- **Transcript:** Part III ~0:00–25:00
- **Slides:** 310–355 (approx)
- **Evaluation:** [08_harbinger_and_hinge.md](08_harbinger_and_hinge.md)
- **Review focus:** COVID timeline (day-by-day March 2020), D&C 112:24-25 "upon my house" argument, Nelson "hinge point" quote, the half-hour-of-silence calculation (20.8 years), and the Judah–Utah governor mapping. The COVID section is likely the most emotionally charged verbal delivery — watch for personal reflections and audience response.

#### Pass 10: Phase 9 — The Two Great Lights & Culmination
- **Transcript:** Part III ~25:00–1:00:00
- **Slides:** 356–369 + extended
- **Evaluation:** [09_culmination.md](09_culmination.md)
- **Review focus:** Only 13 slides for 35 minutes — Philpot's verbal delivery dominates here. The Kokaubeam word study, future projections (2025–2033), Revelation 14 harvest, Adam-ondi-Ahman, Joseph Smith typology, and his closing testimony. This is where the date-setting claims are likely stated most explicitly and where his personal conviction comes through strongest.

## Findings

*To be populated during review passes.*

### Pass 1: Phase 1 — Foundation
- **Status:** Complete
- **Transcript lines read:** 1–150 (Part I, ~0:00–28:30)
- **New content found:**
  1. **Temple sealing as Second Coming type** (~1:59–8:24): Philpot opens with ~19 minutes of verbal-only argument (no slides) comparing modern Saints missing the Second Coming testimony in the sealing to ancient Jews missing the messianic testimony of their temple. Bridegroom motif: [Matthew 25:1–13](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/matt/25.md), [Revelation 19:7–9](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/rev/19.md), [D&C 33:17](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/33.md). Connects to [1 Nephi 1:19–20](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1.md) — Lehi told Jews their temple testified of Messiah and they wanted to kill him.
  2. **D&C 13 / D&C 128:24** (~4:00–8:00): Sons of Levi offering in righteousness. When fulfilled? What happens to Aaronic Priesthood when it is?
  3. **3 Nephi 7→8 “four days” argument** (~11:26–13:00): Only 4 days between end of 3 Nephi 7 and destruction of 3 Nephi 8:5. People were arguing about whether Christ was coming. “Which one are we?”
  4. **Nelson/Oaks Jewish calendar connections** (~15:00–16:00): Three verified claims — Nelson sustained Passover weekend 2018 (March 31); Nelson died during Days of Awe (Sept 27, 2025); Oaks sustained on Shemini Atzeret (Oct 14, 2025).
  5. **Philpot’s disclaimer** (~14:30): “Everything I do is not intended to convince you I’m right... it’s intended to try to stimulate your mind.”
- **Evaluation changes made:** Added items 8–11 to Key Claims; added 7 verbal-only scripture references; added items 8–9 to In Line evaluation; updated cite count and datestamp.

## Scheduling Notes

- Each pass should take **1–2 rounds** of conversation
- Passes can be done in order or by priority
- Part III Pass 10 (Phase 9) is the highest priority — only 13 slides for 35 minutes means substantial verbal-only content
- Part I Pass 4 (Phase 4) is second priority — the Council of Fifty historical argument likely has more verbal detail than slides captured
- The remaining passes are roughly equal priority

**Estimated total:** 10 passes × 1.5 rounds average = ~15 conversation rounds
