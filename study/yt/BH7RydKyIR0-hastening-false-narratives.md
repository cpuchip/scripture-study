## Step 1: Summary

**Speaker's Main Thesis:**
Katelyn reviews a Church News article reporting Elder Ronald A. Rasband's January 2026 MTC devotional where he countered six false narratives about the Church's growth and the hastening of the Lord's work. Her central message: the hastening is real, the prophets and apostles can see what we cannot, and we need to wake up and participate urgently in the gathering of Israel before the Second Coming.

**Key Claims/Doctrines:**
1. We are witnessing the fulfillment of ancient prophecy — the gathering of Israel and hastening of the Lord's work
2. Elder Rasband's six false narratives are being used to discourage faith and blind people to what's happening
3. The prophets and apostles are *seers* — they see around corners and are trying to prepare us
4. We are "only scratching the surface" of what the Lord has in store
5. The best is yet to come because Jesus Christ is coming again

**Scripture/Conference References Made by Speaker:**
- [1 Nephi 14:14](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14.md) — power of the Lamb descending on covenant people
- [Isaiah 29:14](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/isa/29.md) — marvelous work and a wonder (via Elder Rasband)
- Joseph Smith's 1834 Kirtland prophecy — the Church will fill the world
- President Nelson, "Hear Him" (April 2020) — "front row seats" to witness what Nephi saw in vision
- Elder Rasband's MTC devotional — six false narratives, apostolic promise

---

## Step 2: Discovery

### Supporting Scriptures Found
- [D&C 4:1](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.md) — "a marvelous work is about to come forth among the children of men"
- [D&C 88:73](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md) — "Behold, I will hasten my work in its time"
- [D&C 68:4-6](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.md) — speaking by the Holy Ghost is scripture; "be of good cheer, and do not fear" (cited by Sister Rasband in the MTC devotional)
- [D&C 133:58-59](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133.md) — "the weak shall confound the wise... by the weak things of the earth the Lord shall thresh the nations"
- [Jacob 5:61-75](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5.md) — the allegory of the olive tree, the "last time" when the Lord grafts branches back and labors with servants

### Related Conference Talks Found
- [Elder Rasband, "Right Before Our Eyes," April 2025](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/04/15rasband.md) — directly parallels the MTC devotional; cites the same Joseph Smith 1834 prophecy, same hastening statistics
- [President Nelson, "The Lord Jesus Christ Will Come Again," October 2024](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2024/10/57nelson.md) — "Do you see what is happening right before our eyes? ... The Lord is indeed hastening His work"
- [President Nelson, "Hear Him," April 2020](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2020/04/45nelson.md) — "front row seats to witness live what the prophet Nephi saw only in vision" (1 Nephi 14:14)

---

## Step 3: Deep Reading Checklist

### Sources Referenced by the Video
- [x] [1 Nephi 14:12-17](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14.md) — Full chapter read. Verse 14 confirmed: "they were armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory." Context critical: v.12 says Church numbers are *few* but scattered on *all* the face of the earth; v.13 says multitudes gather to fight the Lamb; v.14 is the Lord's answer — power descends on the covenant people. The context of opposition is what makes the power so remarkable.
- [x] [Isaiah 29:14](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/isa/29.md) — Read in context. Follows v.13's warning about lip-service worship ("their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men"). The marvelous work comes *because* of apostasy — it's both judgment and restoration.
- [x] [President Nelson, "Hear Him," April 2020](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2020/04/45nelson.md) — Full talk read. The "front row seats" quote is verified: "We have front-row seats to *witness live* what the prophet Nephi saw *only in vision,* that 'the power of the Lamb of God' would descend 'upon the covenant people of the Lord.'" The urgency is unmistakable — Nelson follows this with "You, my brothers and sisters, are among those men, women, and children whom Nephi saw. Think of that!"
- [x] Church News article (Elder Rasband MTC devotional) — Fetched and read in full. Six false narratives confirmed. Apostolic promise confirmed: "As you commit your whole souls to your missionary purpose, the Lord will engage you in this great and marvelous hastening of His work." Sister Rasband cited D&C 68:5-6.

### Sources Found in Discovery
- [x] [D&C 4](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.md) — Full section read. "A marvelous work is about to come forth" connects directly to both Isaiah 29:14 and the hastening theme. Footnote on v.1 links to Isaiah 29:14 and 1 Nephi 14:7-17 — the scriptural authors themselves saw these as connected.
- [x] [D&C 88:73](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md) — Read with context. "Behold, I will hasten my work in its time." This is THE verse behind the "hastening" language. President Nelson footnoted this in his Oct 2024 talk. Elder Rasband footnoted it in his April 2025 talk. Context: v.74 follows with a *commandment* to "assemble yourselves together, and organize yourselves, and prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves."
- [x] [D&C 68:4-6](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.md) — Read. V.4 establishes that words spoken by the Holy Ghost ARE scripture. V.6: "Wherefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ."
- [x] [D&C 133:58-59](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133.md) — Read. "The weak shall confound the wise, and the little one become a strong nation." V.59: "By the weak things of the earth the Lord shall thresh the nations by the power of his Spirit." This is directly relevant to False Narrative #6 (missionaries not good enough).
- [x] [Elder Rasband, "Right Before Our Eyes," April 2025](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/04/15rasband.md) — Full talk read. This is the companion piece to the MTC devotional. Same Joseph Smith 1834 prophecy. Same statistics (80,000 missionaries, 308,000 converts, 450 missions). Additional data: 367 temples, 800,000 seminary/institute students. Rasband says: "'Hastening' is a word that matters. It suggests moving quickly, accelerating, and even urgency."
- [x] [President Nelson, "The Lord Jesus Christ Will Come Again," October 2024](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2024/10/57nelson.md) — Full talk read. THIS is the source of the "right before our eyes" phrase that Rasband echoed. Nelson: "Do you see what is happening right before our eyes? I pray that we will not miss the majesty of this moment! The Lord is indeed hastening His work." Also: "The best is yet to come... because the Lord is hastening His work."
- [x] [Jacob 5:61-75](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5.md) — Read the "last time" section. V.61: "the end draweth nigh." V.62: "let us go to and labor with our might this last time." V.70: "the servant went and did as the Lord had commanded him, and brought other servants; and they were *few*." V.71: "this is the last time that I shall nourish my vineyard; for the end is nigh at hand... if ye labor with your might with me ye shall have joy." V.72: "the Lord of the vineyard labored also with them." The Lord works *alongside* His servants.

## Step 4: Evaluation

### In Line

**The hastening is real and prophetically grounded.** Katelyn's central message — that the Lord is accelerating His work and the prophets are testifying of it — is solidly anchored in scripture and modern prophetic testimony:

- **D&C 88:73** is the operative verse: "Behold, I will hasten my work in its time." President Nelson cited this in [his October 2024 farewell address](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2024/10/57nelson.md), and Elder Rasband built his entire [April 2025 conference talk](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/04/15rasband.md) around it. The fact that the MTC devotional continues this theme shows a consistent apostolic priority.

- **1 Nephi 14:14** is powerfully deployed. Both Katelyn and President Nelson focus on this verse — the power of the Lamb descending on the covenant people scattered "upon all the face of the earth." The key word is *power* — not popularity, not political influence. Armed with "righteousness and with the power of God in great glory." This is happening in ways both visible (308,000 baptisms) and invisible (hearts turning to Christ).

- **The six false narratives are data-backed.** Elder Rasband didn't just assert — he provided specific evidence for each point:
  1. More missionaries serving now than in many years
  2. Largest number of convert baptisms in any 12-month period this dispensation
  3. Baptisms increasing in *every* region (Europe with highest percent growth in 2025)
  4. Active participation as high or higher than any previous year
  5. Overwhelming majority completing service
  6. The Lord makes more of His servants than they imagine

- **The Joseph Smith 1834 prophecy** is historically accurate. Elder Rasband used it in both the MTC devotional and his [April 2025 conference talk](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/04/15rasband.md), citing the Teachings of Presidents manual: "It is only a little handful of Priesthood you see here tonight, but this Church will fill North and South America—it will fill the world."

- **Prophets as seers.** Katelyn's emphasis that prophets and apostles are *seers* who "see things that we cannot see" is doctrinally sound. Mosiah 8:17 teaches that "a seer is greater than a prophet... a seer can know of things which are past, and also of things which are to come."

**The "buckle up" urgency is not hype — it's prophetic.** Elder Rasband's statement in the Church News — "I feel that we are only scratching the surface of what the Lord has in store for us as he prepares the world for his second coming. So buckle up, hold on tight, because I firmly believe that the best is yet to come" — echoes President Nelson's October 2024 statement: "The best is yet to come, my dear brothers and sisters, because the Savior is coming again! The best is yet to come because the Lord is hastening His work."

### Out of Line

Nothing doctrinally out of line. Katelyn is primarily reading from and commenting on a Church News article of an apostle's devotional — the source material is solid. Her commentary stays within appropriate bounds.

### Missed the Mark

**Tone leans toward entertainment.** The video's style — snorting sounds, "eating popcorn watching," laughter interjections — occasionally makes sacred themes feel more like fan-culture commentary than devotional study. This isn't *wrong*, but it may inadvertently signal that the Second Coming is more spectacle than sacred. Elder Rasband's own tone in the source material is earnest, urgent, and tender. The video could benefit from more moments of reverence alongside the excitement.

**The "I got the inside scoop" framing is risky.** Katelyn references attending a leadership training and says "I kind of got the inside scoop" about retention statistics. While her enthusiasm is genuine, framing prophetic instruction as "insider information" can subtly shift the focus from the doctrine to the exclusivity of the experience. The actual data Elder Rasband shared is publicly available through the Church News.

### Missed Opportunities

**Jacob 5 — the allegory of the olive tree.** This is the *scriptural backbone* of the hastening and is conspicuously absent from the video. Jacob 5:61-75 describes the "last time" the Lord nourishes His vineyard. The Lord of the vineyard says: "Let us go to and labor with our might this last time, for behold the end draweth nigh" ([Jacob 5:62](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5.md)). Verse 70-71 is remarkable: the servants are *few*, but they labor with their mights, and "the Lord of the vineyard labored also with them." The hastening is not just the Lord directing from above — He is working *alongside* His people. And the branches are being moved and grafted across the vineyard — which is exactly what we see with missionaries, families being moved, and the Church spreading to every nation.

**D&C 4 — the missionary section.** Given that Elder Rasband was speaking to MTC missionaries, the connection to D&C 4 is organic. "Now behold, a marvelous work is about to come forth among the children of men" ([D&C 4:1](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.md)). This is the *same* language as Isaiah 29:14. D&C 4's footnote on verse 1 explicitly links to both Isaiah 29:14 and 1 Nephi 14:7-17. The scriptural editors themselves traced this thread. D&C 4:3 — "if ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work" — directly answers False Narrative #6 about missionaries not measuring up.

**D&C 133:58-59 — the weak shall confound the wise.** This would have powerfully reinforced False Narrative #6. The Lord's pattern is to use *weak things* to overthrow the strong: "the weak shall confound the wise, and the little one become a strong nation... by the weak things of the earth the Lord shall thresh the nations by the power of his Spirit" ([D&C 133:58-59](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133.md)). Missionaries who feel inadequate are *exactly* the Lord's instrument of choice.

**Elder Rasband's April 2025 conference talk.** The MTC devotional and "Right Before Our Eyes" are companion pieces — same prophecies, same data, same urgency. The conference talk adds even more: 367 temples, 800,000 seminary/institute students, the Mendoza Argentina Temple dedication fulfilling Elder Ballard's 1926 prophecy that South America would "become a power in the Church." Referencing this talk would have shown that Elder Rasband's message isn't just a one-time MTC pep talk — it's a sustained, conference-level apostolic witness.

### Overall Assessment

**Spiritually nourishing? Yes.** Katelyn does genuine good work here. She finds a timely Church News article, reads it on-screen, and connects it to prophetic teachings with real enthusiasm. The core message — the hastening is real, the prophets testify of it, and we should wake up and participate — is doctrinally sound and urgently needed.

**Recommend? Yes, with nuance.** Best for viewers who are already familiar with the "signs of the times" discussion and want a quick, energetic review of Elder Rasband's MTC devotional. The video's greatest strength is making prophetic urgency feel accessible and personal. Its greatest limitation is favoring enthusiasm over scriptural depth — the deep Jacob 5, D&C 4, and D&C 133 connections that *prove* the hastening pattern from scripture are left on the table.

For those wanting the full depth, go straight to the source: Elder Rasband's [April 2025 conference talk "Right Before Our Eyes"](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/04/15rasband.md) is a masterpiece of prophetic testimony backed by specific data.

**Rating: In line, enthusiastic, scripturally shallow.** The boat is pointed in the right direction; the oars could go deeper.

## Step 5: Become

> *"Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection."* — [D&C 130:18](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.md)

### Truths to Apply
- The hastening is real and accelerating. This is not hype. An apostle stood before missionaries with specific data and said "we are only scratching the surface." I need to match my urgency to the prophets' urgency.
- The Lord works *alongside* His servants. Jacob 5:72: "the Lord of the vineyard labored also with them." When I feel overwhelmed by the work, He's not just assigning — He's *doing it with me*.
- Being moved across states to where the Lord needs us is a latter-day olive tree moment. Just as the Lord of the vineyard took young and tender branches and grafted them "whithersoever I will" ([Jacob 5:8](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5.md)), the Lord moves His people to where they can bear the most fruit. Even to "the poorest spot in all the land" — and still bring forth "much fruit" (v.21-22).

### Warnings to Heed
- Don't let excitement become spectacle. The Second Coming of Jesus Christ is the most sacred event in human history. I can be thrilled and trembling at the same time.
- Don't consume prophetic commentary as a *substitute* for the prophets themselves. Read the actual talks. Read the actual scriptures. The video is a pointer, not a source.
- Watch for pessimism masquerading as realism. The false narratives Elder Rasband debunked are everywhere — in news, on social media, even in Gospel Doctrine classes. "They cannot see, they are blind."
