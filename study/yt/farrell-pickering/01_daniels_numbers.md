## Summary

Pickering opens with a fireside introduction to the Sisters of Liberty group and sets up his thesis: "The numbers are solid" — his mathematical framework from Adam to now confirms we are near the end of 6,000 years and the 7th millennium is approaching. He walks through Daniel 8:13-14 (the 2,300 days), argues the vision is about the *whole* end-times period rather than just the daily sacrifice, reads Daniel 8:23-25 (king of fierce countenance), introduces the Ezra's Eagle / 2 Esdras reinterpretation of Trump as the "middle head" (not necessarily bad), classifies Trump in D&C 76:75 terrestrial terms ("honorable men… deceived by the craftiness of men"), warns against replacement theology (Daniel is about Jerusalem, not about us — read the Book of Mormon for what's about us), and closes with Rhonda reading Isaiah 56:7-8 (house of prayer) and Daniel 8:15-19 (Gabriel explaining the vision to Daniel, "at the time appointed the end shall be" = moed/feast day).

## Scriptures Cited — Verified

### Daniel 8:13-14 — The 2,300 Days

> "Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed." — [Daniel 8:13-14](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/dan/8.md)

**Pickering's reading:** The question in v. 13 is about "the vision" — a whole scope of events — not just the daily sacrifice. The daily sacrifice is one component mentioned within the larger vision. The 2,300 days covers the full arc from start to cleansing.

**Evaluation:** This is a defensible reading of the Hebrew. The verse does say "the vision *concerning* the daily sacrifice and the transgression of desolation" — the vision is the bigger container. Where Pickering goes astray is in his certainty about *when* this vision starts. The text provides the duration (2,300 days) but the start date requires external identification of a triggering event. Pickering later identifies Hanukkah 2024 prayer on the Temple Mount as the start — which is interpretive, not textual.

### Daniel 8:23-25 — King of Fierce Countenance

> "And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up. And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people. And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand." — [Daniel 8:23-25](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/dan/8.md)

**Pickering's reading:** This king destroys "the mighty and holy people" — which is Judah/Jerusalem, not us (Ephraim). He connects this to a future antichrist figure, possibly from Turkey (based on the Antiochus Epiphanes typology), whose allies are Islam.

**Evaluation:** The chapter heading confirms the historical referent: "a fierce king who will destroy the holy people — This king will be broken when he stands up against the Prince of Princes." The dual-fulfillment reading (historical Antiochus + eschatological antichrist) has scholarly support, but Pickering's Turkey-origin claim is pure conjecture built on typological reasoning, not textual evidence. He acknowledges this ("total feral conjecture").

### D&C 76:75 — Terrestrial: Honorable Men Deceived

> "These are they who are honorable men of the earth, who were blinded by the craftiness of men." — [D&C 76:75](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.md)

**Pickering's use:** Applied to Donald Trump — a good man, doing what he believes, but not calling America to repentance, therefore "terrestrial" material rather than "celestial" / prophetic.

**Evaluation:** This is a misapplication of the verse. D&C 76:71-80 describes the *final state* of those who inherit the terrestrial kingdom in the resurrection — not a personality classification for living political figures. The section describes those who "died without law" (v. 72), "received not the testimony of Jesus in the flesh, but afterwards received it" (v. 74), and "are not valiant in the testimony of Jesus" (v. 79). Using this to categorize a sitting president as "good but not prophet material" treats a doctrine of eternal kingdoms as a political evaluation tool. The underlying point — that being a good leader doesn't make someone a prophet — is valid, but the scriptural vehicle is strained.

### Isaiah 56:7-8 — House of Prayer for All People

> "Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people. The Lord God which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered unto him." — [Isaiah 56:7-8](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/isa/56.md)

**Rhonda's reading:** This was displayed on Israeli television when Ben Gvir prayed on the Temple Mount at Hanukkah 2024. It's a chiasm: house of prayer → offerings accepted on the altar → house of prayer. The center of the chiasm (offerings on the altar = daily sacrifice) is embedded within the prayer framework.

**Evaluation:** This is actually one of the strongest moments in Phase 1. The chiastic observation is valid — the burnt offerings/sacrifices are indeed sandwiched between the two "house of prayer" statements. The connection to the Temple Mount prayer events is at least interesting exegetically. However, Isaiah 56's broader context (vv. 1-8) is about *inclusion* — strangers and eunuchs being welcomed into covenant worship — not about prophetic timelines. The verse was used by Jesus in [Mark 11:17](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/mark/11.md) to condemn commercial corruption of the temple ("My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves"). So the verse *is* about the Temple Mount, but its prophetic application to 2024 Jewish prayer rights is interpretive overlay, not textual demand.

### Daniel 8:15-19 — Gabriel: "At the Time Appointed the End Shall Be"

> "And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be." — [Daniel 8:19](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/dan/8.md)

**Pickering's reading:** "Appointed" = Hebrew *moed* = feast day. The "prophetic appointments" ministry name comes from this. Christ fulfilled his first-coming mission on Passover, and he will fulfill all end-times events on feast-day schedules.

**Evaluation:** The word *moed* does indeed mean "appointed time, meeting, or season" and is the same word used for the Levitical feast days (Lev 23:2, "the feasts of the Lord, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts"). The connection between *moed* and feast-day fulfillment is legitimate Hebrew scholarship. Christ's crucifixion on Passover, burial during Unleavened Bread, and resurrection on Firstfruits are historically attested feast-day fulfillments. The *question* is whether this pattern gives us permission to calculate *specific* future dates on feast-day calendars. Scripture says the pattern is real; it does not say we can reverse-engineer the timeline.

## Scriptures Not Cited but Relevant

### D&C 49:7 — The Guardrail

> "I, the Lord God, have spoken it; but the hour and the day no man knoweth, neither the angels in heaven, nor shall they know until he comes." — [D&C 49:7](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49.md)

This is the most important verse Pickering does *not* engage with in Phase 1. His entire framework assumes calculable dates ("the numbers are solid… the math seems to be rock solid"). D&C 49:7 says flatly that "no man knoweth" and even the *angels* don't know. Not "the precise day," but "the hour and the day." The Lord's own words in [JS—Matthew 1:40](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1.md) reinforce this: "But of that day, and hour, no one knoweth; no, not the angels of God in heaven, but my Father only."

Pickering might respond that he's not predicting the Second Coming itself but identifying intermediate prophetic events. That's a fair distinction — but when you give a framework where "you can't hardly stretch it at best 3 or 4 years" from the 7th millennium, you are functionally date-setting the whole eschatological sequence.

### JS—Matthew 1:37 — The Antidote to Deception

> "And whoso treasureth up my word, shall not be deceived, for the Son of Man shall come, and he shall send his angels before him with the great sound of a trumpet." — [JS—Matthew 1:37](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1.md)

The antidote is not numerical calculations — it's treasuring up the Lord's word. This doesn't disqualify studying Daniel's numbers, but it recenters the priority.

### 3 Nephi 2:1-3 — The Signs Parallel

> "And it came to pass that thus passed away the ninety and fifth year also, and the people began to forget those signs and wonders which they had heard, and began to be less and less astonished at a sign or a wonder from heaven." — [3 Nephi 2:1](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/2.md)

Pickering references this pattern (people stopped paying attention because things didn't happen on their schedule) to justify continued watchfulness. This is actually a good use of the Book of Mormon text. The comparison is apt — the Nephites dismissed the signs because fulfillment didn't match their timeline. However, the lesson cuts *both ways*: the Nephites who set specific dates for the sign's fulfillment were also wrong. The correct position was *faithful watching* without date-setting.

## 2 Esdras / Ezra's Eagle — The Apocryphal Question

Pickering uses 2 Esdras (Ezra's Eagle) extensively to identify Trump as "the middle head of the eagle" and the United States as the fourth beast of Daniel 7. He acknowledges using AI to find alternative translations of the Ezra's Eagle text.

**D&C 91 Standard:** The Lord's instruction on the Apocrypha is clear:

> "There are many things contained therein that are true, and it is mostly translated correctly; There are many things contained therein that are not true, which are interpolations by the hands of men… whoso is enlightened by the Spirit shall obtain benefit therefrom; And whoso receiveth not by the Spirit, cannot be benefited." — [D&C 91:1-2, 5-6](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/91.md)

This is neither a blanket endorsement nor a blanket rejection. It's a *conditional permission* dependent on the Spirit. The problem is that Pickering treats 2 Esdras as having near-scriptural authority for building political predictions ("I made that presentation pretty strong last time"). The D&C 91 standard requires discernment, not confidence. And when he uses *AI to generate alternative translations* of an apocryphal text to make it fit his thesis, we've moved quite far from "the Spirit manifesteth truth."

## Evaluation

### In Line

1. **Daniel is about Jerusalem, not us.** Pickering's correction against replacement theology is well-placed: "If you want to know what's going on with us, read the Book of Mormon. Really… you've got to keep the Book of Mormon as your main model of what's going on with us." This is a genuinely important hermeneutical principle that many LDS end-times enthusiasts ignore.

2. **The *moed* / feast-day pattern is real.** The Hebrew connection between "appointed time" and feast days is legitimate, and Christ's first-coming fulfillments on the spring feasts are historically attested. This is good scholarship.

3. **Signs require persistence, not date-matching.** The 3 Nephi 2 allusion — people stopped watching because things didn't happen on schedule — is a valid and important Book of Mormon lesson.

4. **Isaiah 56:7-8 chiasm.** Rhonda's chiastic reading of the house of prayer / offerings / house of prayer structure is textually sound and adds genuine insight.

### Out of Line

1. **Date-setting against D&C 49:7.** "The math seems to be rock solid… you can't hardly stretch it at best 3 or 4 years" directly contradicts the Lord's declaration that "the hour and the day no man knoweth, neither the angels in heaven." If even angels don't know, a calculator doesn't either.

2. **Classifying a living person's eternal kingdom.** Applying D&C 76:75 ("honorable men… blinded by craftiness") to Donald Trump treats the doctrine of kingdoms of glory as a political taxonomy. This verse describes the *resurrected state* of individuals, not a personality type.

3. **AI-retranslated Apocrypha as evidence.** Using AI to generate alternative translations of 2 Esdras to support a pre-existing thesis about Trump inverts the D&C 91 standard. The Spirit manifests truth; AI finds word patterns.

### Missed the Mark

1. **"The numbers are solid" vs. "details might not be 100%."** Pickering hedges well ("I could be wrong on details") but then asserts the framework with "rock solid" confidence. The hedge provides cover; the confidence drives the audience's takeaway. If your details keep being wrong (he went to Israel expecting the red heifer sacrifice and it didn't happen), perhaps the framework itself deserves more humility.

2. **Turkey-origin antichrist.** The Antiochus typology is a reasonable starting point, but jumping from "the original antichrist prototype was Syrian-Greek" to "the actual antichrist will probably come out of Turkey" with "I'm not saying that's an absolute" treats typology as geography. Types teach *patterns*, not GPS coordinates.

3. **America can only be humbled by betrayal.** "I don't think there is a military power on the earth that's going to take us on head to head. It's going to be a betrayal." This may be geopolitically reasonable but is presented as near-prophetic insight. Scripture offers another possibility: the Lord himself humbles nations that ripen in iniquity ([Ether 2:10-12](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/ether/2.md)), not just through military rivals.

### Missed Opportunities

1. **Daniel 12:4 — "Seal the book, even to the time of the end."** Pickering doesn't mention that Daniel himself was told the meaning was sealed until the end. This should have prompted humility about whether *we* can unseal it with math.

2. **Daniel 12:8-9 — "I heard, but I understood not."** Even Daniel didn't understand his own vision. The angel told him: "Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end." If Daniel couldn't decode it, perhaps we should hold our decoding lightly.

3. **JS—Matthew 1:46-48 — "Watch… for you know not."** The Lord's counsel isn't "calculate" but "watch." Pickering's framework replaces watching with calculating. These are different postures.

## Become

**What truth can I apply?**
- The Daniel-is-about-Jerusalem principle is important. When I study prophetic texts, I should always ask: *who is the original audience?* before mapping events onto my own concerns.
- Feast-day fulfillment (*moed*) is worth studying deeper — the spring feasts → first coming connection is well-established; the fall feasts → second coming connection is worth exploring with proper humility.
- The 3 Nephi 2 lesson cuts both ways: don't stop watching, but don't assume your timeline is God's timeline.

**What warning should I heed?**
- "The numbers are solid" is the kind of confidence that D&C 49:7 was written to check. When someone says "the math can't be wrong but the details might be," the "details" are actually the *only falsifiable claims*. An unfalsifiable framework isn't solid — it's just unfalsifiable.
- Using AI to retranslate ancient texts to fit a thesis is a genuinely new epistemic danger. The Spirit, not an LLM, is the interpreter of uncertain texts.

**Specific commitment:**
Study Daniel 8 in full — reading the footnotes and cross-references carefully — before proceeding to Phase 2. Let the text speak before the presenter does.
