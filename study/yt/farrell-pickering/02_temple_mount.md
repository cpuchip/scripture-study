## Summary

This is the most experiential phase of the presentation. Pickering shifts from Daniel's numbers to Temple Mount archaeology, showing video footage from his December trip to Israel. He interviews the head of Palestinian security on the Temple Mount, debunks the "City of David" temple location theory using the 46-well water argument, argues that Solomon's temple was at the Dome of the Spirits (not the Dome of the Rock), proposes Herod moved the temple to the Dome of the Rock during his 17 BC reconstruction, uses dowsing rods to "confirm" these locations, shares a deeply personal 1996 spiritual experience in the olive grove, and concludes with the practical implication: the third temple could be built without removing the Dome of the Rock.

## Scriptures Cited — Verified

### Genesis 22:2 — Abraham Offers Isaac on Moriah

> "And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of." — [Genesis 22:2](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/22.md)

**Pickering's use:** Abraham went from Salem (city of Melchizedek in the City of David) up to Mount Moriah to offer Isaac — the same site where Solomon's temple was later built, at the Dome of the Spirits.

**Evaluation:** The connection between Moriah and the Temple Mount is well-established. [2 Chronicles 3:1](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/2-chr/3.md) explicitly says: "Then Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem in mount Moriah." The tradition that Abraham's offering was at the temple site is ancient and shared by Jewish, Christian, and Islamic tradition. Whether Moriah = Dome of the Spirits vs. Dome of the Rock is where Pickering adds his own reading. The text doesn't specify which peak.

### 2 Samuel 24:18-25 — David Purchases the Threshing Floor

> "And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the Lord in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite… So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. And David built there an altar unto the Lord." — [2 Samuel 24:18, 24-25](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/2-sam/24.md)

**Pickering's argument:** A threshing floor has to be flat. The Dome of the Rock sits on an exposed rock outcropping that is anything but flat. Therefore, the threshing floor David purchased was at the Dome of the Spirits (a flatter area), and that's where Solomon built the temple — not over the Dome of the Rock.

**Evaluation:** This is actually one of Pickering's more interesting arguments. Threshing floors do need to be relatively flat and exposed to wind. The bedrock under the Dome of the Rock is famously uneven. However, 2,000+ years of construction, demolition, and modification makes terrain arguments speculative. The rock surface visible today inside the Dome of the Rock may have been modified by Herod's construction or earlier work. The argument is suggestive but not conclusive.

### John 2:19-20 — "Forty and Six Years"

> "Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?" — [John 2:19-20](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/john/2.md)

**Pickering's use:** Herod began reconstruction in 17 BC; 46 years of building brings us to about 29-30 AD, which is when Christ says this. Then 3 years later (49 years total), Christ atones.

**Evaluation:** The timeline math is roughly consistent with historical scholarship. Josephus records that Herod began temple reconstruction around 19-17 BC (there's scholarly debate on the exact year). John notes the claim "46 years in building," which aligns. However, Pickering attributes a typological significance to "49 years" (a Jubilee cycle) that isn't in the text — John 2:21 immediately clarifies: "But he spake of the temple of his body." Jesus wasn't talking about buildings at all.

### Ezekiel 44:1-3 — The Sealed Eastern Gate

> "Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it was shut. Then said the Lord unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the Lord, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut." — [Ezekiel 44:1-2](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/ezek/44.md)

**Pickering's use:** The Eastern Gate alignment — the line of sight from Gethsemane through the Eastern Gate should point directly to the Holy of Holies. This alignment works with the Dome of the Spirits but *not* with the Dome of the Rock (which is off-center).

**Evaluation:** The Eastern Gate alignment is a real feature of Temple Mount geography that scholars have noted. Whether the alignment points to the Dome of the Spirits vs. the Dome of the Rock depends on which Eastern Gate opening you measure from and how you define "straight through." Pickering presents this as decisive; honest cartography presents it as suggestive. It's worth noting that Ezekiel 44 is describing a *future* temple, not Solomon's historical one.

## The Dowsing Rods Problem

This phase is dominated by Pickering's use of dowsing rods ("the rods") to "confirm" the location of the Holy of Holies, the altar of sacrifice, and where Abraham offered Isaac. He asks questions aloud, and the rods visually respond by pointing in a direction.

### D&C 8:6-9 — The Gift of Aaron

> "Now this is not all thy gift; for you have another gift, which is the gift of Aaron; behold, it has told you many things; Behold, there is no other power, save the power of God, that can cause this gift of Aaron to be with you." — [D&C 8:6-7](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8.md)

Some Latter-day Saints cite D&C 8 as scriptural precedent for divining rods, noting that the Book of Commandments original text explicitly mentions a "rod of nature" and a "gift of working with the rod." The 1835 revision changed this to "the gift of Aaron."

**Critical distinction:** D&C 8 was given to *Oliver Cowdery specifically*, about *his particular gift*, for the purpose of *translating ancient records* (v. 11). It was not a general authorization for using divining rods. And even Oliver's gift didn't work — D&C 9 explains he "feared" and didn't exercise faith properly, and the Lord told him to "study it out in your mind" instead.

**The epistemological problem:** Pickering uses the rods to ask location questions ("Where is the Holy of Holies?"), then is *amazed* at the answers, then uses those answers as *evidence* for his thesis. This is circular: he brings the hypothesis, asks the rods, the rods confirm, and the confirmation validates the rods. There's no falsification mechanism. He acknowledges this somewhat ("whether you believe it or not"), but then builds his entire Temple Mount argument on rod-confirmed locations.

**The scriptural standard:** The Lord's method of revealing truth is described in D&C 8:2 — "I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost." Not in your hands, by the movement of metal rods. The Spirit bears witness through thoughts and feelings (v. 2-3), not through mechanical instruments.

## The 1996 Olive Grove Experience

Pickering shares what he describes as a sacred personal revelation: while sitting in the olive grove near Gethsemane in 1996, a voice told him to "stop, turn, look west" — and he saw through the Eastern Gate to where the Holy of Holies was. He was moved to tears and told Rhonda, "God just told me where the Holy of Holies is."

This is the most difficult moment to evaluate. We do not dismiss personal spiritual experiences. The Lord speaks to His children, including through audible impressions ([1 Kings 19:12](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/19.md), [D&C 8:2](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8.md)). But we also note:

1. **Personal revelation is for the person.** Pickering's experience, if genuine, was for *him* — it doesn't constitute evidence for *us*. The scriptural pattern is that revelation for others comes through those with stewardship over those others ([D&C 28:2-7](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/28.md)).

2. **Confirmation bias risk.** Pickering went to Israel already interested in Temple Mount questions. A spiritual impression in a sacred place could genuinely be from God — or it could be the Spirit bearing witness of Christ's atonement (which happened *right there*), which Pickering then interpreted as archaeological instruction.

3. **He then spent decades building on it.** "That's enough to get your curiosity going, right?" — a 1996 impression became the foundation for a research program, dowsing rod verification, and public presentations. That's a lot of superstructure on one impression.

## Evaluation

### In Line

1. **The City of David temple theory is weak.** Pickering is right to pushback against the theory that Solomon's temple was in the City of David (the "Gihon Spring" theory promoted by Robert Cornuke and others). The mainstream archaeological consensus places the temple on the Temple Mount platform. The 46-well water argument from the Palestinian security chief, while not scholarly evidence, does illustrate that water access was available on the mount.

2. **Herod's reconstruction was massive.** The historical fact that Herod dramatically expanded and rebuilt the Temple Mount complex is well-attested (Josephus, *Antiquities* 15.380-425). The idea that he *moved* the temple's position during reconstruction is speculative but architecturally plausible. As a builder himself, Pickering brings a practical eye to this question.

3. **The practical implication is genuinely significant.** If the correct temple location is the Dome of the Spirits rather than the Dome of the Rock, the political obstacle to a third temple drops dramatically. No one would need to demolish Al-Aqsa or the Dome of the Rock. This is not a new idea — the scholar Asher Kaufman published this theory in 1983 — but Pickering brings it to a popular LDS audience effectively.

4. **Helena's wrong sites protecting the real ones.** This is an interesting historical observation. Whether or not it's *God's* strategy (as Pickering implies), the fact that major church buildings were built on incorrect historical sites is well-documented by archaeologists.

### Out of Line

1. **Dowsing rods as archaeological method.** Using divining rods to identify the Holy of Holies, the altar of sacrifice, and where Abraham offered Isaac is not a scripturally sanctioned method of obtaining truth. D&C 8 does not authorize it for anyone but Oliver Cowdery, and even his gift was contingent on the Spirit, not mechanics. Pickering then presents rod-confirmed hunches as "what I know for me" — blurring the line between personal conviction and sharable evidence.

2. **Blood recording sins / earth recording everything.** The tangent about Christ's blood "recording" our sins and the earth "recording everything we're doing" and blood being the mechanism for resurrection — none of this has scriptural support. It appears to be folk doctrine mixed with a misreading of [Moses 7:48](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md) (the earth groaning under wickedness) and [D&C 88:25-26](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md) (the earth abiding celestial law). The atonement's mechanism is not biological recording.

3. **Overconfidence in unprovable claims.** "This is the correct location" (of Solomon's temple), stated as fact, based on dowsing rods and a 27-year-old personal impression. Scholarly archaeology has debated this question for decades without consensus. The Dome of the Spirits theory is *one* legitimate hypothesis (Kaufman 1983), but stating it as confirmed fact oversteps.

### Missed the Mark

1. **Ron Wyatt claims introduced without caveat.** The passing reference to Wayne's tours and the Ark of the Covenant under the crucifixion site comes from the Ron Wyatt tradition — archaeological claims that have been thoroughly discredited by professional archaeologists (including Christian ones). Pickering doesn't push back on these claims at all.

2. **"I'm not trying to sell anything."** Pickering leads paid Israel tours. He's literally selling tickets to visit these locations. The disclaimer rings hollow in context and should have been omitted or replaced with transparency about his financial interest.

### Missed Opportunities

1. **2 Chronicles 3:1** — "Then Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite." This verse *explicitly* connects Moriah, Solomon's temple, and the threshing floor. Pickering references all three separately but could have anchored the argument here.

2. **Hebrews 9:1-12** — The tabernacle/temple as a *type* of heavenly realities. The New Testament's perspective is that the physical temple was always pointing to something greater. Obsessing over the *exact location* of the Holy of Holies misses the point that Christ entered "the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands" (Heb 9:11). The location matters less than the atonement it pointed to.

3. **The atonement happened right there.** Pickering is standing in Gethsemane, the actual site of the actual atonement, and his primary interest is *which rock the Holy of Holies was over*. The type is standing next to the antitype, and he's examining the type with rods. This is the wrong priority.

## Become

**What truth can I apply?**
- Don't dismiss experience, but don't build a career on a single impression either. Hold personal spiritual experiences with gratitude and humility — they're for me, not for establishing doctrine.
- The Herod reconstruction argument is architecturally interesting and worth filing as plausible context, without the certainty Pickering attaches.

**What warning should I heed?**
- Dowsing rods are not the Holy Ghost. The Spirit speaks "in your mind and in your heart" (D&C 8:2), not through metal instruments. When someone says "you don't have to believe the rods" but then bases their entire argument on rod-confirmed locations, the hedge provides no cover.
- Standing at sacred sites is an opportunity for spiritual communion, not archaeological confirmation bias.

**Specific commitment:**
Read [Hebrews 9](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/heb/9.md) — the temple as type of heavenly realities — before Phase 3. Let the New Testament perspective on temples reground the conversation.
