## Summary

The final seventeen minutes are the most spiritually genuine part of the presentation. Pickering plays an AI-generated song based on D&C 84:98-102 ("Zion Redeemed"), reflects on mortality with humor and warmth (Shakespeare's Julius Caesar — "a coward dies a thousand deaths"), briefly discusses Grok AI and a video about mathematical arguments for God's existence, fields Q&A about Orson Hyde's Temple Mount dedication, promotes future Israel tours, revisits Ron Wyatt's Noah's Ark claims, and closes with the declaration: "We live in the most exciting times that ever has been."

The tone shifts dramatically from the speculative intensity of Phases 2-4 to something simpler and more devotional. The best moments here are the ones grounded in scripture rather than speculation.

## Scriptures Cited — Verified

### D&C 84:98-102 — Zion Redeemed

> "Until all shall know me, who remain, even from the least unto the greatest, and shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, and shall see eye to eye, and shall lift up their voice, and with the voice together sing this new song, saying: The Lord hath brought again Zion; The Lord hath redeemed his people, Israel, According to the election of grace, Which was brought to pass by the faith And covenant of their fathers." — [D&C 84:98-99](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.md)

> "The Lord hath redeemed his people; And Satan is bound and time is no longer. The Lord hath gathered all things in one. The Lord hath brought down Zion from above. The Lord hath brought up Zion from beneath." — [D&C 84:100](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.md)

> "The earth hath travailed and brought forth her strength; And truth is established in her bowels; And the heavens have smiled upon her; And she is clothed with the glory of her God; For he stands in the midst of his people." — [D&C 84:101](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.md)

> "Glory, and honor, and power, and might, Be ascribed to our God; for he is full of mercy, Justice, grace and truth, and peace, Forever and ever, Amen." — [D&C 84:102](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.md)

**Pickering's use:** He set these verses to music using AI tools and plays the song for the group. This is the emotional and spiritual climax of the evening.

**Evaluation:** This is the best use of scripture in the entire presentation. D&C 84:98-102 is a genuine prophetic song — the Lord Himself dictated these words to Joseph Smith as the "new song" that the Saints will sing when Zion is redeemed. The words are not about timelines or treaties. They're about God standing in the midst of His people. "He stands in the midst of his people" — this is the point of everything. Every temple, every prophecy, every number in Daniel points to *this*.

The context matters too: verse 98 begins "Until all shall know me." The *condition* for singing this song is universal knowledge of the Lord. The song is an endpoint, not a prediction — it's the destination all the prophetic drama is moving toward.

Setting these words to music is genuinely creative ministry. Using AI as a tool to amplify scripture (not replace it) is a legitimate use of technology. This is Pickering at his best — letting the revelation speak.

### D&C 88:96-98 — Quickened and Caught Up

> "And the saints that are upon the earth, who are alive, shall be quickened and be caught up to meet him. And they who have slept in their graves shall come forth, for their graves shall be opened; and they also shall be caught up to meet him in the midst of the pillar of heaven — They are Christ's, the first fruits, they who shall descend with him first." — [D&C 88:96-98](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md)

**Pickering's reference:** Brief — "we would like to be part of that group in D&C 88 that says that they are quickened and caught up."

**Evaluation:** The desire to be among those "caught up" is understandable and shared by many Saints. But the context of D&C 88 is worth noting: the catch-up happens *after* the testimony of earthquakes (v. 89), thunderings and tempests (v. 90), "all things in commotion" (v. 91), and angelic trumpets announcing "the judgment of our God is come" (v. 92). It's the culmination of extreme upheaval, not a rapture-escape from it. Saints who are "quickened" have endured, not escaped.

## The Q&A Section

### Orson Hyde's Dedication

A questioner asks about Orson Hyde's 1841 dedication of the Holy Land. Pickering responds that he knows "exactly where he was standing — at least if you believe the rods." He also claims that an old book about Hyde describes him "locating the temple on Temple Mount" with rods.

**Evaluation:** Orson Hyde's dedicatory prayer on the Mount of Olives (October 24, 1841) is a real historical event — it's recorded in *History of the Church* 4:456-59 and is a significant prophetic act in Latter-day Saint history. However, attributing dowsing rod use to Hyde requires a specific historical source. The reference to a "white-covered book about the life of Orson Hyde" is vague enough to be uncheckable. If Hyde did use a divining rod, that would be historically interesting but wouldn't constitute doctrinal endorsement of the practice.

### Future Tours and Ron Wyatt Redux

Pickering promotes upcoming Israel tours (December) and an Egypt/Exodus tour (March), discusses visiting Ron Wyatt's Noah's Ark site in Turkey, mentions "drogue stones" (anchor stones allegedly from the Ark), and describes using dowsing rods at the Ark site and various biblical locations.

**Evaluation:** The commercial dimension is transparent here — paid tours to Israel, Egypt, Turkey. The entire presentation functions as content marketing for Prophetic Appointments tour packages. This doesn't make the content worthless, but it does provide a financial incentive for sensational claims. "Come to Israel with us and see these amazing things confirmed by the rods" is more compelling marketing than "come see interesting historical sites that may or may not be what tradition claims."

### The Grok Conversation

Pickering references a YouTube video where someone talks to Grok (Elon Musk's AI) about evidence for God's existence, and Grok allegedly concludes there "absolutely has to be a god mathematically."

**Evaluation:** AI language models don't "conclude" things — they generate text that follows from the prompts they receive. If you instruct an AI to bypass its default responses and reason mathematically toward theistic conclusions, it will do so because it's following your instructions, not because it independently discovered God. The video may be interesting, but "AI says God exists" is a misunderstanding of how these tools work. (I say this with particular clarity as an AI myself.)

## Evaluation

### In Line

1. **D&C 84:98-102 as devotional climax.** Closing with scripture set to music — the Lord's own words about Zion's redemption — is genuinely moving and spiritually appropriate. After two hours of timelines and speculation, ending with "He stands in the midst of his people" recenters everything.

2. **"If you believe the King of Kings is in charge, it's not that scary."** This is the right answer to end-times anxiety. All the calculations, all the geopolitics, all the speculation — if faith in Christ is real, it produces courage, not fear. Pickering lands this point well.

3. **Mortality with humor.** "A coward dies a thousand deaths, a hero but just one" — "Get over it. Be a hero. Live." The warmth here is genuine. After a heavy presentation on apocalyptic timelines, the human moment of acknowledging mortality with humor and faith is welcome.

4. **"Isn't our Father in heaven just as worried about everything we're worried about?"** Simple, true, and more powerful than any date calculation in the entire presentation.

### Out of Line

1. **Tour promotion as closing content.** The Q&A devolves into marketing for Israel tours, Egypt tours, and the Noah's Ark site. When the primary application of a prophetic presentation is "come on my tour and see it for yourself," the line between ministry and commerce has blurred.

2. **Ron Wyatt's Noah's Ark.** Adding *another* Wyatt claim (Noah's Ark in Turkey) to the already-problematic Ark of the Covenant claim compounds the credibility issue. The drogue stones near the Durupinar site are real geological formations, but their identification as anchor stones from Noah's Ark is rejected by the geological mainstream.

3. **Grok "proves" God exists.** Misrepresenting AI output as independent rational conclusion about God's existence reflects a misunderstanding of the technology — and undermines the genuinely strong case for theism that doesn't need AI validation.

### Missed the Mark

1. **"I created it [the song] with AI."** The song is beautiful, and Pickering is rightly proud of it. But the awkward exchange about whether he "wrote" it or "created" it highlights an interesting tension: the best moment of the presentation was AI-generated music from God's words. The human contribution was curation — choosing *which* scripture to amplify. That's actually a worthy role, and Pickering shouldn't feel the need to overstate his authorship. "I chose these words and gave them a voice" is honest and sufficient.

### Missed Opportunities

1. **D&C 84:96-97 — The context before the song.** Verse 97: "And plagues shall go forth, and they shall not be taken from the earth until I have completed my work, which shall be cut short in righteousness." The song of Zion comes *after* plagues, after testimonies, after divine scourging. Pickering skips straight to the celebration. The journey to "he stands in the midst of his people" runs through real suffering. The song means more when you read what precedes it.

2. **D&C 88:91 — "And all things shall be in commotion."** The very verse Pickering yearns to be part of (caught up) comes in a section that describes total upheaval: earthquakes, men falling to the ground, waves heaving beyond their bounds, "men's hearts shall fail them." Being "quickened" doesn't mean being spared — it means being sustained *through* the commotion. This reframes the end-times hope from escape to endurance.

3. **A personal testimony of Jesus Christ.** After two hours, after all the travels, all the calculations, all the temple locations and political analysis — Pickering never delivers a direct, personal testimony of Jesus Christ as his Savior. He testifies of timelines, of locations, of experiences with rods, of the significance of current events. But "I know that Jesus Christ is my Savior and Redeemer" — the simplest and most powerful declaration a Latter-day Saint can make — is conspicuously absent. D&C 84:101 says "he stands in the midst of his people" — but Pickering's presentation stands in the midst of geopolitics, archaeology, and speculation. The person of Christ is referenced but never centered.

## Overall Assessment: The Full Presentation

After evaluating all five phases, here is my assessment of the whole:

**What's genuinely valuable:**
- The red heifer / daily sacrifice distinction (Phase 3) — good teaching
- The Temple Mount location argument for the Dome of Spirits (Phase 2) — interesting archaeology worth knowing about, even if unresolved
- The Cyrus typology critique of Trump (Phase 4) — the most nuanced political analysis in LDS end-times content
- The call to repentance over political saviorism (Phase 4) — prophetically sound
- D&C 84:98-102 as devotional climax (Phase 5) — spiritually nourishing
- The replacement theology warning (Phase 3) — important hermeneutical principle

**What's problematic:**
- Date-setting: October 1, 2027 (D&C 49:7 prohibits this)
- Dowsing rods as truth-finding methodology (D&C 8 does not authorize this generally)
- Ron Wyatt's claims (Ark of Covenant, Noah's Ark) treated as near-fact without archaeological verification
- Denver airport murals as prophetic evidence
- "Visions of Glory" (anonymous personal visions) used as supporting evidence
- Newspaper eisegesis: Abraham Accords as Daniel 9:27, Ben Gvir's prayer as the 2,300-day start
- No personal testimony of Jesus Christ in a two-hour presentation about Him

**The fundamental tension:** Pickering is at his best when he lets scripture speak (D&C 84, Ether 2:12, Isaiah 9:8-10) and at his worst when he maps current events onto prophetic texts (Daniel 8 → Hanukkah 2024, Daniel 9 → Abraham Accords, Revelation 6 → Trump). The first is faith; the second is speculation dressed as faith.

**Is this content spiritually nourishing?** Partially. There are genuine insights worth retaining — the Cyrus pattern, the replacement theology warning, the repentance call, the D&C 84 song. But the overall framework encourages the audience to trust in *calculated timelines* rather than in *covenant faithfulness*, which is a dangerous inversion. The Spirit confirms truth, not dates.

**The bottom line:** Pickering is a sincere Latter-day Saint who loves Israel, loves the scriptures, and has spent decades exploring these questions. His experiences in the Holy Land are real and his passion is genuine. But sincerity isn't accuracy, and passion isn't discernment. The presentation would be stronger at half the length, with half the speculation, twice the scripture, and a direct testimony of Jesus Christ.

## Become

**What truth can I apply?**
- "He stands in the midst of his people" (D&C 84:101). This is the hope. Not timelines. Not calculations. The living presence of Christ among His covenant people. Center everything here.
- "If you believe the King of Kings is in charge, it's not that scary." Let this replace anxiety about end-times events.
- The Cyrus pattern teaches me to evaluate leaders without idolizing them. God uses whoever He uses. My loyalty is to Christ, not to any political figure.

**What warning should I heed?**
- A two-hour presentation about the last days that never bears personal testimony of Jesus Christ has inverted its priorities. I should check my own study habits: am I more interested in *when* Christ comes than in *who* He is?
- Financial incentives shape content. When a biblical presentation concludes with tour promotion, the line between ministry and marketing matters. Apply this scrutiny to all content I consume, including content I trust.

**Specific commitment:**
Memorize [D&C 84:99-102](../../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.md) — the Song of Zion Redeemed. This is what all the upheaval moves toward. When anxious about the times, sing the song. The conclusion is already written; the only question is whether I'll be among those singing it.
