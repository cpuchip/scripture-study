## Presenter Background

Farrell Pickering is a Latter-day Saint builder/contractor who runs the "Prophetic Appointments" ministry with his wife Rhonda. He leads Israel tours, has traveled extensively to Jerusalem and the Temple Mount, and presents at events like Rod Meldrum's Book of Mormon conference. His approach centers on Daniel's numerical prophecies (particularly the 2,300 days of Daniel 8 and the 70 weeks of Daniel 9), Jewish feast-day fulfillment, and modern geopolitical developments in Israel. He's learning Hebrew, uses dowsing rods for archaeological verification (controversial), and references Ron Wyatt's archaeological claims. He co-presents with his wife Rhonda, and the talk has a casual fireside atmosphere with frequent audience interaction.

## Study Approach

This study follows the **Video Evaluation workflow**:

1. **Discovery → Deep Reading → Writing** rhythm for each phase
2. **Cite count rule:** For every source cited, `read_file` the actual source
3. **Search tools find *what* to study; `read_file` is how we *actually study it***
4. **Webster 1828** for historical word meanings where relevant
5. **Honest evaluation:** In Line / Out of Line / Missed the Mark / Missed Opportunities

---

## Key Themes to Watch

1. **Date-setting:** Pickering sets specific dates (October 1, 2027 for the covenant confirmation, 6,000 years ending now). D&C 49:7 and Matthew 24:36 are the scriptural guardrails.
2. **Dowsing rods:** Used extensively to "verify" locations in Jerusalem. This is a significant methodological concern — is this consistent with how the Lord reveals truth?
3. **Geopolitical speculation:** Trump as Cyrus, Turkey as source of Antichrist, Abraham Accords as the covenant of Daniel 9:27. How much is scripture and how much is newspaper eisegesis?
4. **2 Esdras / Apocrypha usage:** D&C 91 provides the standard — "whoso is enlightened by the Spirit shall obtain benefit therefrom."
5. **Non-canonical sources:** Ron Wyatt claims, Denver airport murals, "Visions of Glory" — these are not scripture and should be evaluated accordingly.
6. **Replacement theology critique:** Pickering rightly warns against both Mormon-centric and Christian-centric replacement theology — does he then fall into his own version?

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Daniel's Numbers & the 2,300-Day Framework
**Transcript:** ~0:00–22:00 | **Output:** [01_daniels_numbers.md](01_daniels_numbers.md)

**Content:**
- Introduction — "Sisters of Liberty" fireside, red heifer rehearsal at Shiloh
- Daniel 8:13-14 — the 2,300 days, daily sacrifice, transgression of desolation
- Correction: the vision is about the whole end-times period, not just the daily sacrifice
- "The numbers are solid" — mathematical framework from Adam to now
- 6,000 years ending, 7th millennium approaching
- Daniel 8:23-25 — king of fierce countenance, little horn
- 2 Esdras Eagle reinterpretation — Trump as middle head (not necessarily bad)
- D&C 76 — terrestrial kingdom, "honorable men deceived by craftiness of men"
- Trump: good but not calling America to repentance
- America's humbling by betrayal, not head-to-head confrontation
- Isaiah 56:7 — "house of prayer for all people" (chiasm)
- Daniel's "appointed times" — moed / feast-day fulfillment

**Key Scriptures to Verify:**
- Daniel 8:13-14, 23-25 (2,300 days, king of fierce countenance)
- D&C 76:75 (terrestrial — honorable men deceived)
- Isaiah 56:7-8 (house of prayer)
- D&C 49:7 (hour and day no man knoweth)

**Evaluation Focus:** Is the 2,300-day calculation sound? Does Daniel 8 actually support a Hanukkah 2024 start date? Is the Esdras Eagle a valid interpretive framework per D&C 91?

---

### Phase 2: Temple Mount — Location, Archaeology & the Holy of Holies
**Transcript:** ~22:00–48:00 | **Output:** [02_temple_mount.md](02_temple_mount.md)

**Content:**
- Interview with Palestinian security chief on Temple Mount
- Temple location debate: City of David theory refuted
- 46 water wells on Temple Mount — water argument debunked
- Dome of the Spirits vs. Dome of the Rock
- Solomon's temple at Dome of Spirits; Herod moved it to Dome of Rock
- Dowsing rods used to verify temple locations (controversial methodology)
- 1996 personal revelation experience at the olive grove
- Herod's 17 BC reconstruction — building a new temple while keeping sacrifices going
- Threshing floor of David — flat surface argument for Dome of Spirits
- Constantine's mother Helena — wrong sites protected the real ones
- Alignment through the Eastern Gate to the Holy of Holies
- Implications: third temple could be built without removing the Dome of the Rock

**Key Scriptures to Verify:**
- Genesis 22 (Abraham offering Isaac on Mount Moriah)
- 2 Samuel 24:18-25 (David purchasing the threshing floor)
- John 2:19-20 (46 years of temple building)
- Ezekiel 44:1-3 (Eastern Gate sealed)

**Evaluation Focus:** Does the archaeological argument for Solomon's temple at the Dome of Spirits hold scholarly weight? How should we evaluate dowsing rods as a truth-finding method against scriptural standards (D&C 8, Oliver Cowdery's gift)?

---

### Phase 3: Ben Gvir, Jewish Prayer & the 2,300-Day Start
**Transcript:** ~48:00–1:24:00 | **Output:** [03_prayer_on_temple_mount.md](03_prayer_on_temple_mount.md)

**Content:**
- Ben Gvir — Israel's Minister of National Security
- Hanukkah 2024: Ben Gvir prays on Temple Mount (while Jews were still being arrested for it)
- Ben Gvir's policy change: free worship for Jews on Temple Mount
- Jerusalem Day celebrations — Jews singing on Temple Mount
- This is identified as the "start of the 2,300 days" — prayer, not sacrifice
- Red heifer rehearsal at Shiloh (practice run, not the actual offering)
- Red heifer is an offering/purification, not the daily sacrifice (an important distinction)
- Ron Wyatt — Ark of the Covenant under crucifixion site, blood dripped onto it
- Under Temple Mount tour: Solomon's Stables, 5 stories deep
- Discussion of Zedekiah's cave and restricted tunnels
- Replacment theology warning: Daniel is about Jerusalem, not us; Book of Mormon is about us

**Key Scriptures to Verify:**
- Daniel 8:13-14 (does this match prayer as the starting event?)
- Numbers 19 (red heifer ordinance)
- Exodus 29:38-42 (daily sacrifice — tamid)
- Isaiah 56:7 (house of prayer)
- 3 Nephi 20-21 (Jerusalem restoration prophecies)

**Evaluation Focus:** Is there scriptural warrant for identifying Hanukkah 2024 as the 2,300-day start? Does equating "prayer on Temple Mount" with the beginning of Daniel's vision hold up against the text? The Pickerings' insight that Daniel is about Jerusalem/Judah while the Book of Mormon is about us — is this sound hermeneutics?

### Phase 4: Daniel 9:27, Trump as Cyrus & False Peace
**Transcript:** ~1:24:00–1:51:00 | **Output:** [04_false_peace.md](04_false_peace.md)

**Content:**
- Daniel 9:27 — "confirm the covenant" vs. "make the covenant"
- Abraham Accords as the existing covenant; Turkey's sign-on = confirmation
- Trump as dealmaker — "philosophers said the world will end in the Middle East; we're not going to let that happen"
- Pickering's critique: Trump called prophets "philosophers" and claims he can prevent prophecy
- Cyrus typology: Trump facilitates 3rd temple but is not a righteous man
- D&C 76 terrestrial classification of Trump
- Isaiah 9:8-10 (Harbinger) — pride of building better, not repenting
- Revelation 6 — white horse with bow (covenant/rainbow, not weapon) = peace by treaty
- Denver airport murals as prophetic imagery: towers falling, plague, peace treaty, young Trump-like figure
- October 1, 2027 — projected date for the treaty (from Daniel's numbers)
- King of North (Shiite/Iran/Russia/China) vs. King of South (Sunni/Saudis/West)
- Western nations turning against Israel (UK, France, Canada, Ireland)
- America's judgment first → building New Jerusalem
- "Visions of Glory" — underground silo splits the country
- The only solution is repentance, not political solutions

**Key Scriptures to Verify:**
- Daniel 9:27 (confirm the covenant)
- Isaiah 9:8-10 (harbinger/pride)
- Revelation 6:1-2 (white horse)
- D&C 76:75-79 (terrestrial kingdom)
- Ether 2:12 (this is a choice land)
- 3 Nephi 16:10-15 (Gentiles lifted up in pride)
- D&C 87 (prophecy on war)
- D&C 49:7 (no man knoweth the hour)

**Evaluation Focus:** Is the Abraham Accords = Daniel 9:27 covenant identification sound exegesis or newspaper eisegesis? Does the white horse = treaty interpretation hold up in Greek? Is the Cyrus typology helpful or misleading? How does "we're not going to let that happen" sit against D&C 121:33 ("God's arm is stretched out still")?

### Phase 5: The Millennial Hope & Closing
**Transcript:** ~1:51:00–2:08:18 | **Output:** [05_millennial_hope.md](05_millennial_hope.md)

**Content:**
- D&C 84:98-102 — "Zion Redeemed" (AI-generated song from scripture)
- "If you believe the King of Kings is in charge, it's not that scary"
- Shakespeare's Julius Caesar: "a coward dies a thousand deaths"
- D&C 88 — "quickened and caught up"
- Denver airport final panel: tree of life, Adam-ondi-Ahman scenario
- AI discussion: Grok 4 / Answers in Genesis — mathematical proof of God
- Q&A: Orson Hyde's dedication on Mount of Olives/Temple Mount
- Future Israel and Egypt tours planned
- Ron Wyatt — Noah's Ark in Turkey, drogue stones
- Closing emphasis: trust in God, not treaties of men

**Key Scriptures to Verify:**
- D&C 84:98-102 (Zion redeemed)
- D&C 88:96-98 (quickened and caught up)
- Dedication of the Holy Land (Orson Hyde, 1841)

**Evaluation Focus:** Does the presentation end on a spiritually nourishing note? Is the D&C 84 scripture used in proper context? Does the overall message point people to Christ or to speculative timelines?

|--------|-------|--------------|
| 2 Esdras (Ezra's Eagle) | US politics, middle head = Trump | Medium — D&C 91 permits with Spirit |
| Ron Wyatt | Ark of Covenant under crucifixion site | High — unverified archaeological claims |
| Denver airport murals | Prophetic imagery of Trump, peace treaty | High — speculative pattern-matching |
