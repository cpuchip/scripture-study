## The Unique Nature of Youth

### They Have Great Potential

> "Many experiences recorded in the scriptures illustrate that God has confidence in the spiritual abilities of young people."

**Scriptural Examples:**
- Joseph Smith - 14 years old at the First Vision ([JS-H 1:7](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.md))
- Mormon - entrusted with sacred records at age 10 ([Mormon 1:2-4](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/morm/1.md))
- Nephi - "I will go and do" as a young man ([1 Nephi 3:7](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.md))
- David - faced Goliath as a youth ([1 Samuel 17](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/1-sam/17.md))
- Samuel - called to prophesy as a child ([1 Samuel 3](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/1-sam/3.md))

**What This Means for Teachers:**
- Trust them
- Express confidence
- Help them see what Heavenly Father knows they can become
- Don't give up on them

### They Are Learning About Themselves

Youth are:
- Forming the **foundations of their testimony**
- **Discovering their beliefs** and convictions
- Making decisions that will **affect the course of their lives**

**Critical Need:** To survive spiritually in these times, youth need to know how to:
1. Find **strength** during trials
2. Find **answers** to their questions
3. Find **courage** to stand as witnesses

### They Learn Differently

> "Youth have a growing desire to learn things by **reasoning and experience** rather than by simply being told things."

**Implication:** You can't just tell them what to believe. They need to:
- Wrestle with questions
- Have personal experiences
- Exercise faith themselves

### They Need to Feel Understood

Good **listening skills** are essential. When youth feel understood, they become:
- More open to counsel
- More open to guidance

---

## What Youth Need from Teachers

### 1. Assurance the Lord Knows Them

> "Assure them that the Lord knows them and will help them as they wrestle with questions and trials."

### 2. Daily Habits

Help them develop:
- Daily prayer
- Daily scripture study
- Regular service

### 3. Personal Experiences

> "Encouraging youth to participate in Church classes and study on their own can help them have personal experiences that will build their testimony of their divine heritage."

### 4. Trust and Vision

> "If the youth sense that you trust them, their confidence in their divine potential will grow and they will amaze you with what they can accomplish."

## Technology Considerations

Youth are often comfortable with technology. Teachers should:
- **Teach them how to use** electronic scriptures and Gospel Library
- **Send resources** to help them prepare for lessons
- See devices as **tools to enhance learning**, not distractions

## Application: Teaching YW About "Focus on Christ"

### Bridge to YW

When teaching Young Women teachers about focusing on Christ:

**Connect to their reality:**
- Young women are wrestling with identity, belonging, purpose
- They're making choices about standards, friends, future
- They need to know Christ isn't just a historical figure—He's *their* Savior

**Help teachers see:**
- How to connect ANY topic to Christ (not just obvious ones)
- How to help YW *experience* His love, not just hear about it
- How to create space for the Spirit to testify

### Questions for Teacher Council Discussion

1. Think of a young woman you teach. What is she struggling with right now? How can Jesus Christ help her specifically?

2. What topic are you teaching next? How can you help it point to Christ?

3. When have you seen a young woman have a real experience with the Savior—not just learn about Him?

4. How do you create an environment where youth feel safe to share spiritual experiences?
