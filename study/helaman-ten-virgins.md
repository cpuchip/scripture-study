# The Book of Helaman Is the Parable of the Ten Virgins

*A cross-reference study connecting [Why Did Mormon Include This?](helaman-why.md) with [The Parable of the Ten Virgins](ten-virgins-parable.md)*

## The Discovery

Reading Helaman 1 through 3 Nephi 11 while asking "Why did Mormon include this?" — and then setting that next to the parable of the ten virgins — reveals something startling: **Mormon wrote the parable into the history.** Not literally, of course. But the same principles the Savior would later encode in ten sentences about virgins and oil, Mormon encoded across twenty-seven chapters of civilizational collapse and redemption.

The parable isn't just an illustration. Helaman through 3 Nephi is the parable *lived out* — across a nation, over decades, with names and dates and body counts.

## The Framework

Elder Bednar gave us the key in ["Converted unto the Lord"](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2012/10/converted-unto-the-lord.md) (October 2012):

- **Lamp** = testimony (knowing the gospel is true)
- **Oil** = conversion (knowing *Him* who is the Truth)

And the Lord Himself interpreted the parable in [D&C 45:57](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.md):

> "For they that are wise and have **received the truth**, and have **taken the Holy Spirit for their guide**, and have **not been deceived** — verily I say unto you, they shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire, but shall abide the day."

Three elements: (1) received the truth, (2) taken the Holy Spirit as guide, (3) not been deceived.

Now watch what happens when you lay those three elements across the Helaman narrative.

## All Ten Virgins Were Covenant Members

President Johnson's observation lands like a hammer:

> "Consider that **all ten virgins chose the covenant path**. All were invited to the wedding feast. All carried lamps. They all went out to meet the bridegroom."

This is the Nephites. All of them. Every person in Helaman 3 through 3 Nephi 7 is a covenant member — part of the people of Nephi, recipients of the law of Moses, heirs to the promises of Lehi and Nephi. They all had lamps. They all went "out to meet the bridegroom."

And the Lamanites who converted? They also chose the covenant path. They also carried lamps. They also went forth.

The difference — the *only* difference — was the oil.

---

## Testimony Without Conversion: The Nephite Pattern

The Nephites had testimony. They had abundant evidence. They had:

- Prophets who declared the truth openly ([Helaman 7–10](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/7.md))
- Signs and wonders multiplying ([Helaman 16:13–14](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/16.md))
- A night without darkness — the most dramatic sign in their history ([3 Nephi 1:15–19](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1.md))
- Victory over the Gadianton robbers by divine intervention ([3 Nephi 4:33](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/4.md))
- A moment where "there was not a living soul among all the people of the Nephites who did doubt in the least the words of all the holy prophets" ([3 Nephi 5:1](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/5.md))

That's a flame. That's a burning lamp. They *knew*.

But as 3 Nephi 6:18 states with devastating clarity: "They did not sin ignorantly, for they knew the will of God concerning them, for it had been taught unto them; therefore they did **wilfully rebel** against God" ([3 Nephi 6:18](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6.md)).

They knew — and it wasn't enough. They had testimony but not conversion. Lamps but not oil.

Elder Bednar's warning rings through the centuries:

> "**Testimony alone is not and will not be enough to protect us in the latter-day storm of darkness and evil in which we are living.** Testimony is important and necessary but not sufficient to provide the spiritual strength and protection we need. Some members of the Church with testimonies have wavered and fallen away."

"Some members of the Church with testimonies have wavered and fallen away." That's the book of Helaman in one sentence.

---

## Conversion Without Testimony? The Lamanite Path

The Lamanites came from the opposite direction. They didn't start with testimony — they started with almost nothing. Bad traditions. False beliefs. Centuries of hostility toward the covenant people.

But when the truth reached them, something different happened. Samuel describes it:

> "As many of them as are brought to the knowledge of the truth, and to know of the wicked and abominable traditions of their fathers, and are led to believe the holy scriptures, yea, the prophecies of the holy prophets, which are written, which leadeth them to faith on the Lord, and unto repentance, which faith and repentance bringeth a **change of heart** unto them" ([Helaman 15:7](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/15.md))

The path: scriptures → faith → repentance → **change of heart**.

That change of heart *is* conversion. That's oil. And the result?

> "As many as have come to this, ye know of yourselves are **firm and steadfast** in the faith, and in the thing wherewith they have been made free" ([Helaman 15:8](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/15.md))

The Lamanites had oil in their vessels. Not because they had more signs or better evidence — they had *less*. Samuel says so explicitly: "Had the mighty works been shown unto them which have been shown unto you... they never would again have dwindled in unbelief" ([Helaman 15:15](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/15.md)). The Nephites received more light and still fell away. The Lamanites received less light and became firm.

The variable isn't the lamp. It's the oil.

And look at how [Helaman 6:36](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/6.md) describes the Lamanites' secret: "the Spirit of the Lord began to pour out upon the Lamanites, because of their **easiness and willingness to believe** in his words."

Easiness and willingness to believe. That's not intellectual sophistication. That's not dramatic spiritual experience. That's the daily, quiet receptivity that fills a vessel drop by drop.

## The Three Elements of D&C 45:57 — Mapped to Helaman

The Lord said the wise virgins are those who: **(1) received the truth**, **(2) taken the Holy Spirit for their guide**, and **(3) not been deceived**.

Each of these has a Helaman counterpart — and a Helaman failure mode.

### Element 1: Received the Truth

**The wise (Lamanites):** "Led to believe the holy scriptures... which leadeth them to faith on the Lord" ([Helaman 15:7](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/15.md)). They received truth and let it change them.

**The foolish (Nephites):** "They did not sin ignorantly, for they knew the will of God concerning them" ([3 Nephi 6:18](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6.md)). They received truth and held it at arm's length. Knowing without becoming.

The difference isn't access to truth. It's what you *do* with it. President Johnson's question cuts here: "We can know that the Lord is the Christ. But **do we know Him?**"

### Element 2: Taken the Holy Spirit for Their Guide

**The wise:** "The Spirit of the Lord began to pour out upon the Lamanites" ([Helaman 6:36](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/6.md)). They made room for the Spirit by their willingness.

**The foolish:** "The Spirit of the Lord did no more preserve them; yea, it had withdrawn from them because the Spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples" ([Helaman 4:24](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/4.md)). The Spirit withdrew — and the withdrawal was silent. They didn't notice until their strength was gone.

This is the oil running out. Not dramatically. Not all at once. But the Spirit quietly steps back when the heart hardens, when pride creeps in, when "ease and exceedingly great prosperity" become the foundation instead of the rock of the Redeemer. And by the time you reach for the lamp and find it going dark, there's no quick fix. No last-minute flurry.

As Elder Bednar taught: "No shortcut is available; no last-minute flurry of preparation is possible."

### Element 3: Not Been Deceived

**The wise:** The Lamanites who "buried their weapons of war, and they fear to take them up lest by any means they should sin — yea, ye can see that they fear to sin" ([Helaman 15:9](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/15.md)). Their conversion was so deep that they feared sin more than death. You can't deceive someone who has chosen that deeply.

**The foolish:** The rationalization before the storm: "Some things they may have guessed right, among so many; but behold, we know that all these great and marvelous works cannot come to pass" ([Helaman 16:16](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/16.md)). And: "It is not reasonable that such a being as a Christ shall come" ([Helaman 16:18](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/16.md)). They "depend upon their own strength and upon their own wisdom" ([Helaman 16:15](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/16.md)).

And Satan's deception method? "He did go about spreading **rumors and contentions** upon all the face of the land, that he might harden the hearts of the people against that which was good and against that which should come" ([Helaman 16:22](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/16.md)).

Elder Pearson's insight connects: "Many leave the Savior and their covenants **long before they leave His Church**." The Nephites in Helaman 16 haven't left the covenant structure. They're still part of the people of Nephi. But they've been deceived — gradually, imperceptibly, through "rumors and contentions" and dependence on their own wisdom. They left the Savior without leaving the system.

Foolish virgins. Lamps without oil.

## The Anatomy of Oil Running Out

[3 Nephi 2:1–2](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/2.md) is — I believe — the most precise description in all scripture of what it looks like when oil runs out of the lamp:

> "The people began to **forget** those signs and wonders which they had heard, and began to be **less and less astonished** at a sign or a wonder from heaven, insomuch that they began to be **hard in their hearts**, and **blind in their minds**, and began to **disbelieve** all which they had heard and seen — **imagining up some vain thing** in their hearts, that it was wrought by men and by the power of the devil, to lead away and deceive the hearts of the people; and thus did Satan get possession of the hearts of the people again, insomuch that he did blind their eyes and lead them away to believe that **the doctrine of Christ was a foolish and a vain thing**."

Track the sequence:

1. **Forget** — stop remembering spiritual experiences
2. **Less and less astonished** — normalize the miraculous
3. **Hard in their hearts** — stop feeling
4. **Blind in their minds** — stop seeing
5. **Disbelieve** — actively reject what was once known
6. **Imagine up vain things** — replace truth with rationalization
7. **The doctrine of Christ was a foolish and a vain thing** — arrive at the endpoint

That's the lamp going out. Not snuffed — *starved*. The oil ran out gradually, drop by drop, through neglect. Each step is small. Each step feels reasonable. And by step 7, the flame is gone.

Sister Amy Wright's testimony pierces here: "**It was too late to put oil in our lamps. We needed every single drop, and we needed it right now!**" When the crisis comes — whether personal illness or civilizational destruction — you need the oil you've already stored. The 3 Nephi 2 people didn't have it. Nine years of forgetting had drained their vessels.

---

## "I Know You Not" — The Most Terrible Echo

When the bridegroom comes in the parable, the foolish virgins cry: "Lord, Lord, open to us." And he answers: "I know you not" ([Matthew 25:11–12](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/matt/25.md)).

Now read Christ's words in the darkness after the destruction:

> "O all ye that are spared because ye were more righteous than they, will ye not now return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal you?" ([3 Nephi 9:13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.md))

The destroyed cities heard something like "I know you not." The spared people heard the invitation to come in. Same bridegroom. Same moment. Different oil levels.

And the survival criterion — the dividing line between the wise and foolish:

> "It was the **more righteous part** of the people who were saved, and it was they who **received the prophets** and stoned them not; and it was they who had not shed the blood of the saints" ([3 Nephi 10:12](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/10.md))

"Received the prophets." That's it. Not perfection. Not dramatic heroism. They listened to the servants of God.

Compare Samuel's prophet test in [Helaman 13:26–28](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/13.md): the wicked reject prophets who testify of their sins and embrace flatterers who say "all is well." The righteous receive prophets. This is the oil-gathering behavior — and the oil-draining behavior — defined.

---

## One by One: Why Oil Can't Be Borrowed

When Christ appears at the temple in Bountiful, the people go forth to feel His wounds "**going forth one by one** until they had all gone forth, and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know of a surety" ([3 Nephi 11:15](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md)).

One by one. Two thousand five hundred people, and each one reaches their own hand into His side. Each one feels the nail prints individually. Each one *knows* for themselves.

This is why the wise virgins couldn't share their oil.

Elder Bednar asked: "Can the spiritual strength that results from consistent obedience to the commandments be given to another person? Can the knowledge obtained through diligent study and pondering of the scriptures be conveyed to one who is in need?... The clear answer to each of these questions is **no**."

The encounter in 3 Nephi 11 proves it. No one could touch Christ's wounds for someone else. No one could know for someone else. No one could feel the burning in the heart for someone else. One by one. That's conversion. That's oil. It's strictly, stubbornly personal.

And it can't be acquired at the last minute. The people who stood at the temple in Bountiful were the "more righteous part" who had been building their foundation for years — on "the rock of our Redeemer" ([Helaman 5:12](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.md)). Their oil was stored before the destruction came. When the cry went forth at midnight — when the storm hit and the darkness fell — they were ready. They had oil. They had conversion. They *knew* the bridegroom, and the bridegroom knew them.

---

## The Speed Problem: No Last-Minute Flurry

Elder Bednar's warning — "No shortcut is available; no last-minute flurry of preparation is possible" — finds its historical proof in Helaman.

| Cycle | From | To | Duration |
|-------|------|----|----------|
| Helaman 3–4 | Church prosperity | Half territory lost | "Not many years" |
| Helaman 6–7 | Some prosperity | Gadiantons in government | ~6 years |
| Helaman 11 | Famine-driven repentance | "Ripening for destruction" | ~9 years |
| 3 Nephi 5–7 | "Not a living soul who did doubt" | Government destroyed | ~6 years |

The cycles get faster. The recovery windows shrink. The time to gather oil compresses until there is no time left. This is the parable in motion — the bridegroom tarries, the virgins slumber, and then suddenly: midnight. The cry goes forth. And the foolish discover that their lamps have gone dark.

"O that we had repented before this great and terrible day" ([3 Nephi 8:24](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/8.md)). That's the foolish virgins pounding on the closed door. *Before.* They needed the oil *before.*

Elder Rasband's warning haunts: "I fear there are some who are just getting by on a thin skiff of oil, too busy with worldly pressures to properly prepare."

A thin skiff of oil. That's the Nephites of 3 Nephi 6 — prosperous, comfortable, "distinguished by ranks, according to their riches and their chances for learning" ([3 Nephi 6:12](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6.md)). Busy with worldly pressures. Lamps barely flickering. When the storm hit, the thin skiff wasn't enough.

---

## Where Oil Is Gathered: The Parallel Paths

The ten virgins study — drawing from President Johnson, Elder Rasband, and Elder Renlund — identifies how oil is added. The Helaman narrative shows each one in living color:

### Receiving the Prophets

President Johnson: "Every time we study the scriptures and hear His voice, we add oil."

The Lamanites: "Led to believe the holy scriptures, yea, the prophecies of the holy prophets, which are written" ([Helaman 15:7](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/15.md)).

The Nephites: "If a prophet come among you and declareth unto you the word of the Lord, which testifieth of your sins and iniquities, ye are angry with him" ([Helaman 13:26](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/13.md)).

One path adds oil. The other drains it.

### Private Devotion

Elder Renlund: "**Consistent, personal, private acts of devotion** invite the Holy Ghost to guide us."

The faithful remnant in Helaman: "They did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ" ([Helaman 3:35](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/3.md)).

Fasting. Praying. Often. Not publicly. Not for show. The quiet, consistent acts that fill the vessel drop by drop. "Stronger and stronger." "Firmer and firmer." That's oil accumulating.

### Repentance

Elder Rasband: "Oil comes from **repenting and seeking the healing of the Atonement** of Jesus Christ."

The Nephites after the Gadianton war: "They knew it was because of their repentance and their humility that they had been delivered" ([3 Nephi 4:33](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/4.md)). This was their peak. Their vessels were full. They had repented, fought on their knees, and been delivered. Maximum oil.

And then — four years later — the fall. "They had enjoyed peace but a few years" ([3 Nephi 6:16](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6.md)). They stopped repenting. They stopped adding oil. And the flame flickered out.

### The Sacrament (Covenant Renewal)

President Johnson: "Every time we partake of the sacrament with **real intent**, we add oil."

The Nephites in 3 Nephi 5 had full vessels — "not a living soul who did doubt." By 3 Nephi 6, the church was "broken up in all the land save it were among a few of the Lamanites" ([3 Nephi 6:14](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6.md)). What broke? The covenant renewal process. The gathering. The remembering. When the church breaks up, the sacrament stops. And when the sacrament stops, the oil stops flowing.

---

## The Bridegroom Comes to the Temple

Here's the detail that ties it all together. Where does the bridegroom come in the parable? To the marriage feast. Where does Christ come in 3 Nephi? To the temple.

"There were a great multitude gathered together, of the people of Nephi, round about **the temple** which was in the land Bountiful" ([3 Nephi 11:1](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md)).

The wise virgins were *at the feast*. The survivors were *at the temple*. They were in the right place. They were "conversing about this Jesus Christ" ([3 Nephi 11:2](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md)). They were watching. They were listening.

And when the voice came — "not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it being a **small voice** it did **pierce them** that did hear to the center, insomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their **hearts to burn**" ([3 Nephi 11:3](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md)) — they heard it. Not the first time. Not the second. But the third time, "they did open their ears to hear it; and their eyes were towards the sound thereof; and they did look steadfastly towards heaven" ([3 Nephi 11:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md)).

They kept listening. They kept looking up. They didn't give up after the first two times they didn't understand. That persistence — that willingness to keep straining toward the voice — is oil. It's the "easiness and willingness to believe." It's the conversion that says: I will stay at this temple. I will keep listening. I will keep looking up. Even when I don't understand yet.

---

## What the Bridegroom Teaches When He Arrives

And what does Christ teach when He appears? After twenty-seven chapters of complexity — secret combinations, political intrigue, military campaigns, societal collapse, theological debates — He distills everything:

> "He that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil" ([3 Nephi 11:29](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md))

> "Ye must repent, and become as a little child" ([3 Nephi 11:37](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md))

> "Whoso buildeth upon this buildeth upon my rock... And whoso shall declare more or less than this, and establish it for my doctrine, the same cometh of evil" ([3 Nephi 11:39–40](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md))

Stop contending. Repent. Become as a little child. Build on the rock. Nothing more. Nothing less.

That's the oil. It was never complicated. The Nephites made it complicated — with riches, ranks, disputations, sophisticated rationalizations. The Lamanites kept it simple — scriptures, faith, repentance, change of heart.

The wise virgins didn't have more complex theology than the foolish ones. They just had oil — the simple, daily, quiet conversion that comes from knowing Him, not just knowing *about* Him.

---

## D&C 33: The Command That Bridges Both Studies

The passage in [D&C 33:13–17](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/33.md) connects Helaman's rock, the ten virgins' oil, and the temple in one sweep:

> "And upon this **rock** I will build my church; yea, upon this rock ye are built, and if ye continue, the **gates of hell** shall not prevail against you." (v. 13)

> "The Book of Mormon and the holy scriptures are given of me for your **instruction**; and the power of my **Spirit** quickeneth all things." (v. 16)

> "Wherefore, be faithful, praying always, having your **lamps trimmed and burning**, and **oil with you**, that you may be **ready at the coming of the Bridegroom**." (v. 17)

The rock of [Helaman 5:12](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.md). The gates of hell from [3 Nephi 11:39](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md). The scriptures that converted the Lamanites ([Helaman 15:7](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/15.md)). The Spirit that withdrew from the Nephites ([Helaman 4:24](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/4.md)) and poured out upon the Lamanites ([Helaman 6:36](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/6.md)). The lamps. The oil. The Bridegroom.

It's all one story.

## The Synthesis

| Parable Element | Helaman / 3 Nephi Equivalent |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Ten virgins** | The Nephite nation — all covenant members |
| **Lamps (testimony)** | Evidence, signs, prophets, instruction — all abundantly given |
| **Oil (conversion)** | "Easiness and willingness to believe" → "change of heart" → "firm and steadfast" |
| **Wise virgins** | The Lamanites; the "more righteous part" who survived to 3 Nephi 11 |
| **Foolish virgins** | The Nephites who "did not sin ignorantly" but chose pride over conversion |
| **Bridegroom tarrying** | The decades between Samuel's prophecy and Christ's coming |
| **All slumbered and slept** | Even the righteous live in a world of waiting; the question is what's in the vessel when they wake |
| **The midnight cry** | The destruction of 3 Nephi 8 — the storm, the darkness, the voice |
| **"Give us of your oil"** | Conversion can't be borrowed. It's one by one — [3 Nephi 11:15](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md) |
| **"I know you not"** | The destroyed cities who rejected Christ's servants |
| **"They that were ready went in"** | The more righteous at the temple in Bountiful, touching His wounds |
| **The door shut** | "O that we had repented **before** this great and terrible day" ([3 Nephi 8:24](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/8.md)) |

## What This Means for Us

Elder Pearson said: "Many leave the Savior and their covenants long before they leave His Church."

That's the book of Helaman. That's the foolish virgins. Still in the wedding party. Still carrying a lamp. Still technically part of the group going forth to meet the bridegroom. But the oil has been draining — through pride, through prosperity, through "less and less astonished," through depending on their own wisdom instead of the Spirit.

President Benson said Helaman "corresponds to our day." If so, then we are the ten virgins right now. All of us. The question Mormon is asking across twenty-seven chapters — and the question President Johnson asked in April 2025 — is the same:

> "The question is not: Do we have a testimony?
>
> The question is: **Are we converted?**
>
> Do we *know* the gospel is true? Or do we *know Him* who is the Truth?"

The Nephites knew the gospel was true. They had lamps. They burned bright after every deliverance, every sign, every prophetic warning.

But the oil — the quiet, daily, personal conversion that comes from scriptures and faith and repentance and change of heart — that's what the Lamanites had. That's what the survivors at Bountiful had. That's what the wise virgins have.

And it's gathered one drop at a time.

---

## Become

1. **Check the oil, not the flame.** It's easy to measure testimony — do I believe? The harder question is: am I being converted? Is my heart changing? Am I becoming more like Him, or just knowing more about Him?

2. **Name the forgetting.** 3 Nephi 2:1 is the oil gauge. Am I becoming "less and less astonished" by the things of God? Am I normalizing my spiritual experiences? Am I starting to "imagine up some vain thing" to explain away what the Spirit has shown me? If so, the oil is draining.

3. **Take the prophet test today.** [Helaman 13:26–28](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/13.md). When a prophet's words testify of things I need to change, what is my reaction? Do I receive, or do I rationalize? The oil grows or drains based on this response.

4. **Add oil daily, not weekly.** The cycles in Helaman compress from decades to years to "but a few years." The time to add oil isn't at some future moment. It's today. Every sacrament taken with real intent. Every scripture read with ears to hear. Every quiet prayer. Every forgiveness that costs something. Drop by drop by drop.

5. **Be at the temple.** Christ came to the temple. The wise virgins were where the bridegroom was. This isn't metaphor — it's instruction. Be at the temple. Regularly. Watching. Conversing about Him. "Looking steadfastly towards heaven" ([3 Nephi 11:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md)). So that when the voice comes, I'm in the place where I can hear it.

6. **Remember: one by one.** My oil is mine. My conversion is mine. My encounter with Christ will be mine. No one can touch His wounds for me. No one can know for me. One by one. That means the work is mine to do — and the promise is mine to claim.
