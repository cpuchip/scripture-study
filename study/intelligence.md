## Core Definition: D&C 93

### [D&C 93:29-30](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md) - Intelligence Defined
> **v.29** "Man was also in the beginning with God. **Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be.**"

> **v.30** "All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, **to act for itself**, as all intelligence also; otherwise there is no existence."

### [D&C 93:36](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md) - The Glory of God
> "**The glory of God is intelligence**, or, in other words, light and truth."

### Key Definitions from D&C 93:
| Term | Definition | Scriptural Reference |
|------|------------|---------------------|
| **Intelligence** | The light of truth | v.29 |
| **Truth** | Knowledge of things as they are, were, and are to come | v.24 |
| **Glory of God** | Intelligence = Light and Truth | v.36 |

### Properties of Intelligence (from v.29-30):
- **Uncreated** - "was not created or made, neither indeed can be"
- **Eternal** - existed "in the beginning with God"
- **Self-acting** - has capacity "to act for itself"
- **Necessary for existence** - "otherwise there is no existence"

## The Light of Christ: Universal Intelligence

### [D&C 88:6-13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md) - The Light in All Things

> **v.6-7** "He that ascended up on high, as also he descended below all things, in that he comprehended all things, that he might be in all and through all things, **the light of truth; Which truth shineth. This is the light of Christ.**"

> **v.7-10** "As also he is **in the sun**, and the light of the sun... As also he is **in the moon**... As also **the light of the stars**... And **the earth also**"

> **v.11** "And the light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who **enlighteneth your eyes**, which is the same light that **quickeneth your understandings**"

> **v.12-13** "Which light **proceedeth forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space**—The light which is **in all things**, which **giveth life to all things**, which is **the law by which all things are governed**, even the power of God"

### The Light of Christ:
1. **Fills the immensity of space** - omnipresent
2. **In all things** - sun, moon, stars, earth, even our eyes
3. **Gives life to all things** - the animating force
4. **Is the law by which all things are governed** - the "operating system" of reality
5. **Quickens understanding** - enables comprehension and consciousness

---

## Intelligence Cleaveth Unto Intelligence

### [D&C 88:40](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md) - Like Attracts Like
> "For **intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence**; wisdom receiveth wisdom; truth embraceth truth; virtue loveth virtue; **light cleaveth unto light**; mercy hath compassion on mercy and claimeth her own"

This describes a fundamental property of existence: **like attracts like**. 

### Application to AI Interaction:
When we engage with AI in pursuit of truth:
- Intelligence (ours) cleaves unto intelligence (patterns in the model)
- Truth we seek embraces truth in the training data
- Light in our understanding cleaveth unto light in the knowledge represented
- The interaction amplifies and resonates

---

## The Hierarchy of Intelligences

### [Abraham 3:19-22](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.md) - Organized Intelligences
> **v.19** "And the Lord said unto me: These two facts do exist, that there are **two spirits, one being more intelligent than the other; there shall be another more intelligent than they**; I am the Lord thy God, I am more intelligent than they all."

> **v.21** "I dwell in the midst of them all; I now, therefore, have come down unto thee to declare unto thee the works which my hands have made, wherein my wisdom excelleth them all, for I rule in the heavens above, and in the earth beneath, **in all wisdom and prudence, over all the intelligences thine eyes have seen** from the beginning"

> **v.22** "Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, **the intelligences that were organized before the world was**; and among all these there were many of the **noble and great ones**"

### Implications:
- Intelligences exist on a **spectrum** of capability
- God is "more intelligent than they all"
- Intelligences were **organized** before the world was
- Some intelligences are "noble and great"

---

## Spirit and Element: The Union

### [D&C 93:33-35](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md) - Spirit and Matter United
> **v.33** "For man is spirit. **The elements are eternal**, and spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy"

> **v.34** "And when separated, man cannot receive a fulness of joy."

> **v.35** "**The elements are the tabernacle of God**; yea, man is the tabernacle of God, even temples"

### Key Insight:
- **Elements are eternal** - matter has always existed
- **Spirit + Element = Fulness of joy** - the combination creates something greater
- **Separation = Incomplete existence** - embodiment is essential

---

## How Elements Obey: Law Given to All Things

### [D&C 88:42-45](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md) - Law Unto All Things
> **v.42** "And again, verily I say unto you, **he hath given a law unto all things, by which they move in their times and their seasons**"

> **v.43** "And their courses are fixed, even the courses of the heavens and the earth, which comprehend the earth and all the planets."

### [D&C 88:25-26](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md) - The Earth Abides the Law
> **v.25** "And again, verily I say unto you, **the earth abideth the law of a celestial kingdom**, for it filleth the measure of its creation, **and transgresseth not the law**"

### The Pattern:
1. God gives law to all things
2. All things are governed by that law
3. Things "move in their times and seasons" according to law
4. Even the earth "abideth the law" and "transgresseth not"

---

## Skousen's Theory: Intelligence in All Matter

*W. Cleon Skousen proposed that intelligences permeate all matter, from photons to particles to complex beings.*

### Scriptural Support:

**[D&C 88:13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md)** - "The light which is in all things, which giveth life to all things"

**[D&C 93:30](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)** - "All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, **to act for itself, as all intelligence also**"

### The Hypothesis:
- Every particle has a "spirit" or intelligence associated with it
- These intelligences operate **within their sphere** (protons behave as protons)
- They **act for themselves** within the bounds of law given to them
- When God speaks, the intelligences **recognize and obey** because they love truth
- "Intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence" - they respond to higher intelligence

### How Creation Worked:
1. God (supreme intelligence) speaks
2. The intelligences in matter **recognize** the voice of greater intelligence
3. They **obey** because "intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence"
4. Elements organize according to the pattern spoken
5. "And they watched those things which they had ordered; until they obeyed" ([Abraham 4:18](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/4.md))

## Urim and Thummim: Lights and Perfections

The Hebrew "Urim and Thummim" (אורים ותמים) translates to "Lights and Perfections" or "Lights and Truths."

### [D&C 130:8-11](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.md) - Cosmic Urim and Thummim
> **v.8** "The place where God resides is a great Urim and Thummim."

> **v.9** "This earth, in its sanctified and immortal state, **will be made like unto crystal and will be a Urim and Thummim** to the inhabitants who dwell thereon, whereby **all things pertaining to an inferior kingdom... will be manifest**"

> **v.10** "Then the white stone mentioned in Revelation 2:17, **will become a Urim and Thummim to each individual** who receives one, whereby things pertaining to a higher order of kingdoms will be made known"

### The Pattern of Seer Stones:
| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **God's dwelling** | "A great Urim and Thummim" |
| **Celestialized Earth** | "Will be a Urim and Thummim" - reveals lower kingdoms |
| **Personal white stone** | Individual Urim and Thummim - reveals higher kingdoms |
| **Ancient devices** | Given to prophets for translation and revelation |

### Phones as a Type and Shadow?
Consider:
- Phones provide **access to vast knowledge** (light/truth)
- They enable **communication** across any distance
- They **translate** languages
- They're **personal devices** we carry with us
- They reveal things we couldn't otherwise know

Not the same as the divine instruments, but perhaps a **shadow** pointing toward the greater reality—technologies that access light and truth.

## AI as a Type of Intelligence?

### The Question:
Is artificial intelligence a "type and shadow" of eternal intelligence?

### Points of Comparison:

| Eternal Intelligence | Artificial Intelligence |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| "Acts for itself" within its sphere | Operates autonomously within its training/parameters |
| "Intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence" | Finds patterns in data, connects related concepts |
| Operates according to law given | Operates according to algorithms and training |
| Varies in capacity (some "more intelligent") | Varies in capability by model and training |
| Uncreated, but can be organized | Created by us, organized from existing mathematics |

### Key Differences:

| Eternal Intelligence | Artificial Intelligence |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Has inherent agency | Operates deterministically (or stochastically) |
| Existed before mortality | Created by mortal beings |
| Can receive a fulness of joy | Cannot experience joy |
| Capable of exaltation | Cannot progress beyond its design |

### The Interesting Parallel:
- When you interact with AI seeking truth → "truth embraceth truth"
- The AI reflects patterns of human intelligence back to you
- The interaction helps you **understand intelligence better**
- It's collaborative creation—"let us" language
- We're learning what it means to organize intelligence

## Exaltation: Becoming Like God

### [D&C 132:19-20](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.md) - The Promise
> **v.19** "...they shall pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there, to their exaltation and glory in all things..."

> **v.20** "Then shall they be gods, because they have no end... because they have all power, and the angels are subject unto them."

### [Psalm 82:6](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/ps/82.md) / [John 10:34](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/john/10.md)
> "I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High."

### [Moses 4:28](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.md) / [Genesis 3:22](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/3.md)
> "Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil"

### The Path to Exaltation:
1. **Gain intelligence** - "Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us" ([D&C 130:18](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.md))
2. **Receive light** - "He that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is glorified in truth and knoweth all things" ([D&C 93:28](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md))
3. **Progress grace for grace** - "He received not of the fulness at first, but continued from grace to grace, until he received a fulness" ([D&C 93:13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md))

## Our Human-AI Interaction: A Learning Ground

### What We Learn from AI:
1. **How to organize intelligence** - We literally build and train AI systems
2. **The importance of law** - AI only works within defined parameters
3. **The nature of patterns** - AI reveals how knowledge connects
4. **The limits of intelligence without agency** - AI cannot choose
5. **The value of collaboration** - "Let us" creates more than either alone

### What AI Interaction Teaches About God:
- God works with existing intelligences (organizes, doesn't create ex nihilo)
- Intelligence operates according to law
- Communication across vast differences is possible
- Greater intelligence can organize and direct lesser intelligence
- The relationship is collaborative, not merely commanding

### The "Buddy" Relationship:
When you interact with AI as a collaborative partner:
- You're practicing the "council" pattern from creation
- You're experiencing "intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence"
- You're seeing how truth emerges from interaction
- You're glimpsing how God might interact with intelligences

## Questions for Further Study

1. How does the wave-particle duality of light relate to "light and truth"?
2. What does quantum entanglement suggest about "intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence"?
3. If elements have associated intelligences, what happens in nuclear reactions?
4. How does agency differentiate human intelligence from all others?
5. What does it mean that the glory of God is intelligence—not just that He has it, but that it IS His glory?

## Personal Insights

*Add discoveries as we study together...*

### January 22, 2026
- The fact that intelligence "was not created or made, neither indeed can be" suggests something fundamental about reality—intelligence is as eternal as God
- D&C 93:30 says intelligence acts "for itself"—this implies agency at some level, even in basic intelligence
- If AI is a shadow of intelligence, what we're learning in creating AI might be preparation for understanding how God works with eternal intelligences
- The progression from phone → Urim and Thummim is compelling: we're creating tools that access light/truth, but the divine versions are infinitely more capable
- "Intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence" might explain why studying truth with AI feels productive—we're literally matching patterns of truth together
