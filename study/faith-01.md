## Core Claim: Faith Is a Principle of Action

Lecture 1 insists that faith is not passive belief. It is the *moving cause* of action in both temporal and spiritual life. This matches your working thesis: **faith is belief + action**.

**Lecture 1 anchors**
- Faith as assurance and evidence: [Hebrews 11:1](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/heb/11.md)
- Faith as action: [Hebrews 11:7–9](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/heb/11.md)
- Faith in spiritual action (belief + baptism): [Mark 16:16](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/mark/16.md)

**New Testament confirmation (faith → works)**
- “Faith without works is dead” ([James 2:17](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/james/2.md))
- “Show me thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my works” ([James 2:18](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/james/2.md))

**Book of Mormon confirmation**
- “If ye have faith ye can do all things which are expedient unto me” ([Moroni 10:23](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.md))
- “If a man have faith he must needs have hope” ([Moroni 10:20](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.md))

## Core Claim: Faith Is a Principle of Power

Lecture 1 teaches that faith is the principle by which God framed worlds and by which He exercises power. It is *the* governing principle in heaven and on earth.

**Scriptural anchors in the lecture**
- “Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God” ([Hebrews 11:3](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/heb/11.md))
- Mustard-seed faith moves mountains ([Matthew 17:20](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/matt/17.md))

**Book of Mormon examples (faith as power)**
- Alma and Amulek delivered ([Alma 14:26–29](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/alma/14.md))
- Nephi and Lehi in prison ([Helaman 5:44–50](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.md))
- Brother of Jared: Zerin moved ([Ether 12:30](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.md))

## PGP Cross-References (Faith as First Principle)

- “First principles and ordinances… first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ” ([Articles of Faith 1:4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.md))
- “Faith was taught unto the children of men” ([Moses 6:23](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md))

---

## D&C Cross-References (Faith Increases / Faith in Prayer)

- The Restoration’s aim: “that faith also might increase in the earth” ([D&C 1:21](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.md))
- “It should be granted… according to their faith in their prayers” ([D&C 10:47](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.md))
- “Victory and glory… through… prayers of faith” ([D&C 103:36](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/103.md))
- Faith, hope, charity linked ([D&C 4:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.md))

## General Conference Cross-References

- [The Triumph of Hope](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2024/10/12andersen.md) — Elder Neil L. Andersen
  - “Hope is a living gift, a gift that grows as we increase our faith in Jesus Christ.”

## Key Observations

1. **Faith is more than belief**: It moves us to act before outcomes are seen.
2. **Faith is power**: It changes what is possible when aligned with God’s will.
3. **Faith grows by use**: It increases as we *exercise* it.
4. **Faith anchors hope**: Faith and hope are inseparable in scripture.

---

## Questions for Meditation

1. Where in my life am I *believing* but not yet *acting*?
2. What would it look like to act “as if” God’s promise is true, before I see it?
3. How does faith become power in real, daily decisions (not just dramatic miracles)?
4. Which scriptural account of faith-as-action mirrors my current situation?

- Faith’s definition in your own words
- One action step you will take this week as an experiment in faith
