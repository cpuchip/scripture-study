# Receiving the Gift

*A study on how we receive the Atonement of Jesus Christ*

---

## The Question

A gift freely given is only a gift if it is received. The Atonement of Jesus Christ is the greatest gift ever offered—but what does it mean to *receive* it? And does the *attitude* with which we receive matter?

> "For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift? Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him, neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift."
>

## The Temple Garden Letter

*Inspiration for this study:*

Someone wrote a letter to a temple matron about the beautiful gardens around the temple. But she hesitated to send it—unsure if her gift of appreciation would be received. This small story echoes a larger truth: even the most sincere gift requires a willing recipient. 

The Savior's gift is always extended. The question is whether we will receive it.

## Two Responses to One Gift

### Those Who Receive Not

[D&C 88:32-33](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md) describes those who "remain" after the resurrections of glory:

> "They shall return again to their own place, **to enjoy that which they are willing to receive**, because they were **not willing to enjoy that which they might have received**."

The tragedy isn't that the gift wasn't offered—it's that it wasn't wanted. They receive only what they're *willing* to receive.

**John 1:11** echoes this same sorrow:
> "He came unto his own, and his own **received him not**."

### Those Who Receive

But the very next verse shows the alternative:

> "But as many as **received him**, to them gave he power to become the **sons of God**, even to them that believe on his name."
>
> — [John 1:12](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/john/1.md)

And in [3 Nephi 9:17](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.md), the Savior Himself confirms:
> "And as many as have **received me**, to them have I given to become the sons of God; and even so will I to as many as shall believe on my name."

Receiving Him transforms us. It makes us His children.

## Three Parts of Receiving a Gift

Elder Patrick Kearon, in [Receive His Gift](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/04/55kearon.md) (April 2025), identifies three parts to gift giving:

| Part | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Giving** | The giver selects, prepares, and presents the gift with thoughtful intention |
| **2. Accepting & Opening** | The recipient accepts the gift—often with surprise, gratitude, excitement—and opens it |
| **3. Receiving** | To truly *receive* is to value it, put it to use, and remember the giver with thankfulness |

> "To receive a gift sincerely given is so much more than accepting and then opening it. It is more, even, than recognising the worth of the gift and expressing gratitude to the giver. **To truly receive a gift, we come to value it for ourselves, put it to full use in our lives, and then remember with thankfulness the giver.**"

### The Danger of Not Receiving

Elder Kearon connects this directly to D&C 88:33:

> "If this priceless gift of understanding—and all the goodness, peace, and hope that flow from it—is left unaccepted, unopened, and unreceived, what a terrible loss for us! What a sadness for the Giver! 'For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift? Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him, **neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift**.'"

---

## The Attitude of Receiving

### "With Meekness"

[James 1:21](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/james/1.md) teaches how to receive:

> "Lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and **receive with meekness** the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls."

**The pattern:**
1. Lay aside what blocks receiving (pride, sin, distraction)
2. Receive with **meekness** (humility, teachability)
3. Let it be "engrafted"—become part of you
4. It then saves your soul

### "As a Little Child"

[3 Nephi 9:22](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.md):
> "Whoso repenteth and cometh unto me **as a little child**, him will I receive, for of such is the kingdom of God."

And [Mosiah 3:19](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.md) expands this childlike posture:

> "The natural man is an enemy to God... unless he **yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit**, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and **becometh as a child**, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father."

| Childlike Quality | How It Helps Us Receive |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Submissive** | Willing to be led |
| **Meek** | Teachable, not resistant |
| **Humble** | Acknowledging need |
| **Patient** | Trusting God's timing |
| **Full of love** | Heart open to the Giver |
| **Willing to submit** | Not demanding our own terms |

### President Holland's Testimony

In [As a Little Child](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/04/13holland.md) (April 2025), President Holland asks:

> "Is there anything sweeter, more pure, or more humble than a child at prayer? It is as if heaven is in the room. God and Christ are so real."

Children receive naturally because they haven't yet learned to block the gift.

## With a Broken Heart and Contrite Spirit

[3 Nephi 9:20](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.md):
> "Ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me **a broken heart and a contrite spirit**. And whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, him will I baptize with fire and with the Holy Ghost."

The sacrifice required to receive is not payment—it is *posture*. We come:
- Not self-sufficient, but **broken** (acknowledging need)
- Not proud, but **contrite** (genuinely sorry for sin)

This is the heart that can receive.

---

## "Him Will I Receive"

[3 Nephi 9:14](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.md):
> "Yea, verily I say unto you, if ye will come unto me ye shall have eternal life. Behold, mine arm of mercy is extended towards you, and **whosoever will come, him will I receive**; and blessed are those who come unto me."

The beautiful reciprocity: As we receive Him, He receives us.

---

## The Door and the Knock

[Revelation 3:20](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/rev/3.md):
> "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, **and open the door**, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me."

The Savior stands ready. He knocks. But we must:
1. **Hear** His voice (attention, listening)
2. **Open** the door (action, willingness)
3. **Receive** Him in (relationship, communion)

He will not force entry. The door handle is on our side.

## "Welcome to the Church of Joy"

In [Welcome to the Church of Joy](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2024/10/24kearon.md) (October 2024), Elder Kearon teaches that true receiving brings transformation:

> "This is an invitation to **receive the Saviour's gift** of peace, light, and joy—to revel in it, to wonder at it, and to rejoice in it every Sabbath."

He quotes Ammon ([Alma 26:35-37](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.md)):
> "Now have we not reason to rejoice? Yea, I say unto you, there never were \[a people] that had so great reason to rejoice as we... my joy is carried away, even unto boasting in my God."

When we truly receive, joy overflows.

---

## The Irony of "Deserving"

Elder Kearon addresses those who feel unworthy to receive:

> "You may be wondering, 'What do I have to *do* to receive this gift from God?' Well, actually, nothing. It is a gift from the Giver. It is simply a fact. Just let it in... Do not block the receiving of this gift with thoughts that you are somehow undeserving. **The reality is none of us is 'deserving'—all the Father's gifts are received only through the merits, mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah.**"

| Human Tendency | Gospel Truth |
|----------------|--------------|
| "I must earn it first" | It is freely given |
| "I'm not worthy" | None of us is—that's the point of grace |
| "I'll receive when I'm better" | Receiving is how we become better |

---

## What Blocks Receiving?

### Unwillingness

[D&C 88:32](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md): "not **willing** to enjoy that which they might have received"

### Pride

[Alma 5:28](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.md): "puffed up in the vain things of the world"

### Double-mindedness

[James 1:6-8](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/james/1.md): "let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea... let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. A **double minded man is unstable** in all his ways."

### Hardened Hearts

[Mosiah 3:15](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.md): "they **hardened their hearts**, and understood not"

---

## What Opens Receiving?

From the scriptures above, the posture of receiving includes:

- **Meekness** ([James 1:21](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/james/1.md))
- **Childlike humility** ([Mosiah 3:19](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.md), [3 Nephi 9:22](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.md))
- **Broken heart and contrite spirit** ([3 Nephi 9:20](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.md))
- **Faith, not wavering** ([James 1:6](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/james/1.md))
- **Willingness** ([D&C 88:32](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md))
- **Coming unto Christ** ([3 Nephi 9:14](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.md), [Moroni 10:30](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.md))
- **Hearing and opening the door** ([Revelation 3:20](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/rev/3.md))

---

## Moroni's Final Invitation

[Moroni 10:30, 32](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.md):
> "Come unto Christ, and **lay hold upon every good gift**, and touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean thing... **Come unto Christ, and be perfected in him**."

The gifts are waiting. The Giver stands ready. The question is: Will we receive?

---

## Personal Application

1. What gifts has God offered that I have not fully received?
2. What blocks me from receiving? (Pride? Unworthiness? Distraction? Unwillingness?)
3. How can I cultivate a childlike, meek, broken-hearted posture?
4. How might my attitude toward the Giver change if I truly received His gift?

---

## A Prayer

*As the temple garden letter writer hesitated—wondering if her gift would be received—may we never leave the Savior wondering the same about us.*

May we receive.
