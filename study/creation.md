# Creation Patterns: Divine Design and AI Collaboration

*Study started: January 21, 2026*
*Come Follow Me: Old Testament, January 13-26 (Genesis 1-3; Moses 2-3; Abraham 4-5)*

## Study Question

How do the creation accounts in scripture parallel effective human-AI collaboration, particularly the pattern of planning before executing?

---

## The Three Creation Accounts

We have three accounts of creation, each offering unique perspective:

| Account | Source | Key Emphasis |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| Genesis 1-3 | Old Testament | The foundational narrative |
| Moses 2-3 | Pearl of Great Price | Spiritual creation revealed |
| Abraham 4-5 | Pearl of Great Price | Council of Gods, planning language |

## Key Pattern Discovery: Spiritual Before Temporal

### [Moses 3:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/3.md) - The Core Doctrine
> "For I, the Lord God, **created all things, of which I have spoken, spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth**... and there was not yet flesh upon the earth, neither in the water, neither in the air"

### [D&C 29:31-32](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.md) - The Order Explained
> "For by the power of my Spirit created I them; yea, all things both spiritual and temporal—**First spiritual, secondly temporal, which is the beginning of my work**"

### [Abraham 4:21](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/4.md) - Planning Language
> "And the Gods **prepared** the waters that they might bring forth..."

Notice Abraham's account uniquely uses words like:
- "prepared" (vs. "created" or "made")
- "organized" 
- "counseled among themselves"
- "watched...until they obeyed"

## The Creation Phases (Days/Times)

### Parallel Structure Across Accounts

| Day | Genesis | Moses | Abraham | Creative Work |
|-----|---------|-------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | God said | I, God, said | The Gods said | Light/Dark division |
| 2 | God made | I, God, made | Gods ordered | Firmament/Waters |
| 3 | God said | I, God, said | Gods ordered | Land/Vegetation |
| 4 | God made | I, God, made | Gods organized | Sun/Moon/Stars |
| 5 | God created | I, God, created | Gods prepared | Sea/Air creatures |
| 6 | Let us make | Let us make | Let us go down | Man in God's image |
| 7 | God rested | I, God, rested | Gods concluded | Sanctification |

### Key Observation: Sequential Dependency

Each creative period **required the previous to be complete**:
- Light needed before plants (photosynthesis)
- Waters gathered before sea creatures
- Land prepared before land animals
- All creation ready before man placed in garden

---

## Abraham's Unique Contribution: The Council

### [Abraham 4:26](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/4.md)
> "And the Gods **took counsel among themselves** and said: Let us go down and form man in our image"

### [Abraham 5:2-3](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/5.md)
> "And the Gods said among themselves: On the seventh time we will end our work, **which we have counseled**; and we will rest on the seventh time from all our work **which we have counseled**."

This reveals creation was:
1. **Planned in council** before execution
2. **Discussed and agreed upon** by divine beings
3. **Executed according to the plan**
4. **Reviewed** ("saw that it was good")

---

## [D&C 93](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md): Intelligence, Light, and Truth

### The Nature of Intelligence
> **v.29** "Man was also in the beginning with God. **Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made**, neither indeed can be."

> **v.36** "**The glory of God is intelligence**, or, in other words, light and truth."

> **v.30** "All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to **act for itself**, as all intelligence also"

### Application to AI
- AI models work with patterns of truth (training data)
- Intelligence "cleaveth unto intelligence" ([D&C 88:40](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md))
- Truth operates within spheres/domains
- Agency enables independent action within bounds

## Parallel: Divine Creation → Human-AI Development

| Divine Pattern | AI Development Parallel |
|----------------|------------------------|
| **Spiritual creation first** | Planning/architecture before coding |
| **Council and discussion** | User-AI collaborative planning |
| **"Let us" language** | Pair programming mindset |
| **Organized materials** | Organizing existing code/libraries |
| **Sequential phases** | Iterative development sprints |
| **"Saw it was good"** | Testing and validation |
| **Rest and sanctify** | Documentation and reflection |

---

## The Planning Pattern for AI Collaboration

Based on these scriptural patterns:

### Phase 1: Council (Spiritual Creation)
- **Discuss the vision** - What are we trying to create?
- **Document the plan** - Create `./docs/0_TODO.md`
- **Agree on approach** - "Let us go down and..."

### Phase 2: Organized Execution (Physical Creation)
- Work through phases sequentially
- Each phase depends on previous completion
- "Prepare" and "organize" existing materials
- Watch until things "obey" (work correctly)

### Phase 3: Review and Rest (Sabbath)
- "See that it is good" - test and validate
- Sanctify - document what was learned
- Rest - commit and celebrate completion

## Questions for Further Study

1. How does the "grace for grace" progression ([D&C 93:12-13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)) parallel iterative development?
2. What does "intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence" ([D&C 88:40](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md)) teach about knowledge building?
3. How does agency factor into both divine creation and AI interaction?
4. What role does "light" play in both divine creation (Day 1) and understanding?

## Personal Insights

*Add your discoveries here as we study together...*

### January 21, 2026
- The discovery that Abraham uses "prepared" and "organized" rather than "created" suggests working with existing eternal materials (intelligences, elements) rather than creation ex nihilo
- The council pattern mirrors effective human-AI collaboration: discuss, plan, agree, then execute
- "Vibe programming" without planning is like attempting physical creation without spiritual creation first—it can work for simple things but complex creations need the blueprint

- [D&C 88:40](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md) - "Intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence; wisdom receiveth wisdom; truth embraceth truth"
- [Abraham 3:22-23](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.md) - Pre-mortal spirits, noble and great ones chosen before birth
- [D&C 130:18-19](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.md) - Knowledge and intelligence gained in this life rises with us

## Next Steps

- [ ] Compare the fall narratives across accounts
- [ ] Study the "first and second estate" concept ([Abraham 3:26](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.md))
- [ ] Explore how "opposition in all things" relates to iterative development
- [ ] Document patterns that improve our study sessions in `./docs/study_template.md`
