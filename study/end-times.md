## Key Scriptural Foundations

### The Lord's Prophecy on the Mount of Olives

The Savior's discourse on the Mount of Olives (preserved in [D&C 45](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.md) and [Joseph Smith—Matthew](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1.md)) provides the clearest timeline of signs:

**Signs Prophesied (D&C 45:26-42):**
1. **Wars and rumors of wars** — "the whole earth shall be in commotion" (v. 26)
2. **Hearts failing** — "men's hearts shall fail them" (v. 26)
3. **Delayed expectation** — "they shall say that Christ delayeth his coming" (v. 26)
4. **Love waxing cold** — "the love of men shall wax cold, and iniquity shall abound" (v. 27)
5. **Gospel light breaking forth** — "a light shall break forth among them that sit in darkness" (v. 28)
6. **Desolating sickness** — "a desolating sickness shall cover the land" (v. 31)
7. **Earthquakes in divers places** (v. 33)
8. **Sun darkened, moon to blood, stars fall** (v. 42)
9. **Signs in heavens and earth** — "blood, and fire, and vapors of smoke" (v. 41)

### The Abomination of Desolation

> "When you, therefore, shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet... stand in the holy place"
> — [Joseph Smith—Matthew 1:12](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1.md)

This dual-fulfillment prophecy applied to Jerusalem's destruction (AD 70) and will be fulfilled again before Christ's return.

### The Times of the Gentiles

[D&C 45:25-30](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.md) describes Israel's scattering and regathering:
- Jews scattered among all nations (fulfilled)
- Gathered again "until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled" (in progress)
- Gospel fulness breaks forth (Restoration, 1830)
- Gentiles reject the fulness → times fulfilled

## Conference Talk Trends: When Does Second Coming Emphasis Pick Up?

### Early Decades (1971-1980): Foundation Period
Strong emphasis on Second Coming themes, setting doctrinal foundation:
- **Elder Bruce R. McConkie** (Oct 1982): "The second coming of the Son of Man will be a day of vengeance and burning and sorrow for the wicked."
- **Elder Mark E. Petersen** (Oct 1972): "The scriptures indicate that in the latter days, shortly before the second coming of the Savior, the signs of the times would be given."
- **President Marion G. Romney** (Apr 1981): Listed restoration, Zion, and gathering of Israel as fulfilled signs.
- **Elder Alvin R. Dyer** (Apr 1971): Taught we live in "the fulness of times," all gospel keys converging before Christ's Second Coming.

### Middle Decades (1980-2000): Emphasis on Preparation
Focus shifted toward practical preparation and avoiding fear:
- **Elder Neal A. Maxwell** (Apr 1988): Warned against "both premature expectations and smug complacency" — stay spiritually alert without fear.
- **Elder Dallin H. Oaks** (Apr 2004): Landmark talk listing four indisputable truths about the Second Coming.

### Recent Era (2004-Present): Intensifying Urgency
Notable increase in Second Coming references from senior leaders:
- **Elder D. Todd Christofferson** (Apr 2019): Urged Church to prepare by "building Zion, gathering Israel, and redeeming ancestors."
- **Elder Christoffel Golden** (Oct 2021): Called for spiritual preparation, warning against deception.
- **President Russell M. Nelson** (Oct 2024): Direct witness — "At His Second Coming, 'the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.'"

### Pattern Analysis
The data suggests:
1. **1970s-80s**: Strong doctrinal teaching on Second Coming mechanics
2. **1990s-2000s**: Balanced between doctrine and lived preparation
3. **2010s-2020s**: **Increasing urgency** from First Presidency and Quorum of Twelve
4. **Post-2020**: Direct calls to prepare for "imminent" return

## The Doctrine: What Happens at His Coming

### The Sequence (D&C 45:44-55)
1. Saints who have died are resurrected and rise to meet Christ ([D&C 45:45](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.md))
2. Christ appears in the clouds with power and great glory ([D&C 45:44](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.md))
3. The arm of the Lord falls upon the nations ([D&C 45:47](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.md))
4. Christ stands on the Mount of Olives, which cleaves in two ([D&C 45:48](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.md))
5. The Jews see His wounds and recognize Him ([D&C 45:51-52](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.md))
6. Satan is bound ([D&C 45:55](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.md))
7. The Millennium begins

### Two Appearances
Scripture distinguishes between:
- **To the righteous**: Coming in glory to reign
- **To the Jews at Jerusalem**: Recognition scene at Mount of Olives

## Restoration-Specific Signs

The Doctrine and Covenants adds signs unique to the last dispensation:

| Sign | Reference | Fulfillment |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Keys of dispensation committed | [D&C 110:16](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/110.md) | 1836, Kirtland Temple |
| Elijah's return | [D&C 110:14-16](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/110.md) | April 3, 1836 |
| Gospel preached worldwide | [D&C 133:37](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133.md) | In progress |
| Zion/New Jerusalem established | [D&C 45:66-67](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.md) | Future |
| City of Enoch returns | [D&C 45:12](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.md), [Moses 7:62-63](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md) | Future |

## How to Prepare: Prophetic Counsel

### "Stand in Holy Places" (D&C 45:32)
The consistent prophetic message across decades:
1. **Temple worship** — "disciples shall stand in holy places"
2. **Keep covenants** — "watch and pray always" ([D&C 61:38](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/61.md))
3. **Treasure up the word** — "whoso treasureth up my word, shall not be deceived" ([JS-M 1:37](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1.md))
4. **Gather with the Saints** — temporal and spiritual gathering
5. **Watch without fear** — "be not troubled" ([D&C 45:35](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.md))

### The Parable of the Ten Virgins
> "Watch, therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour."
> — [D&C 133:11](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133.md)

The five wise virgins had oil (the Holy Ghost, personal conversion) that couldn't be borrowed. Preparation is individual and ongoing.

## Reflection Questions

1. Which signs have I personally witnessed in my lifetime?
2. Am I preparing spiritually (oil in my lamp) or just watching intellectually?
3. What does "standing in holy places" mean practically for my family?
4. How do I watch without fear, maintaining hope and urgency together?
