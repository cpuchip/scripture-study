# Walk with Me: The Life of Enoch and the Building of Zion

**2026 Youth Theme:** *"Walk with Me"* — [Moses 6:34](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)

> "Behold my Spirit is upon you, wherefore all thy words will I justify; and the mountains shall flee before you, and the rivers shall turn from their course; and thou shalt abide in me, and I in you; therefore **walk with me.**" — [Moses 6:34](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)

## The Invitation

The phrase "Walk with me" is one of the most intimate invitations in all of scripture. It is God Himself — Jehovah — speaking to a young, frightened, self-doubting man named Enoch. It is the same invitation He extends to each of us.

The 1828 Webster's Dictionary defines **"to walk with God"** as: *"to live in obedience to his commands, and have communion with him."* Not just obedience — *communion*. A shared life. A relationship.

This year's Come, Follow Me lesson for this scripture notes: *"Surely there's a story behind that verse!"* — referring to the tantalizing one-liner in [Genesis 5:24](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/5.md): *"And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him."* The book of Moses gives us that story — and it is magnificent.

## I. Enoch's Call: A Reluctant Prophet (Moses 6:26–37)

Enoch's story begins with the Spirit descending upon him as he journeyed among the people ([Moses 6:26](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)). A voice from heaven calls him to prophesy against a hard-hearted people who "have gone astray" and "sought their own counsels in the dark" ([Moses 6:28](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)).

Enoch's response is strikingly human:

> "Why is it that I have found favor in thy sight, and am but a lad, and all the people hate me; for I am slow of speech; wherefore am I thy servant?" — [Moses 6:31](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)

He bows to the earth. He doesn't argue theology — he argues *inadequacy*. "I'm young. I'm hated. I can't speak well. Why me?"

### The Pattern of Reluctant Prophets

The footnotes to verse 31 point us to a pattern that stretches across dispensations:

| Prophet | Objection | Scripture |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Enoch** | "I am but a lad, and all the people hate me; for I am slow of speech" | [Moses 6:31](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md) |
| **Moses** | "I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue" | [Exodus 4:10](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/ex/4.md) |
| **Jeremiah** | "I cannot speak: for I am a child" | [Jeremiah 1:6](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/jer/1.md) |
| **Nephi** | Weakness in writing; "I am a man of few words" | [2 Nephi 33:1](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33.md) |
| **Moroni** | "The Gentiles will mock... because of our weakness in writing" | [Ether 12:23](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.md) |

Every one of them felt overwhelmed. **And every one of them became mighty.**

President Eyring captured this beautifully:

> "If you feel a little overwhelmed, take that as a good sign. It indicates that you can sense the magnitude of the trust God has placed in you. It means that you have some small understanding of what the priesthood really is." — [President Henry B. Eyring, "Walk with Me," April 2017](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me.md)

### God's Response: Three Promises

The Lord answers Enoch's fear with three interlocking promises ([Moses 6:32–34](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)):

1. **Protection:** "Go forth and do as I have commanded thee, and no man shall pierce thee."
2. **Utterance:** "Open thy mouth, and it shall be filled, and I will give thee utterance."
3. **Indwelling:** "Thou shalt abide in me, and I in you; therefore walk with me."

The third promise is everything. Not just "I'll protect you." Not just "I'll give you words." But: *I will be in you, and you will be in me. We walk together.*

Elder Bednar unpacked this three-fold structure:

> "Enoch ultimately became a mighty prophet and a tool in God's hands to accomplish a great work, but he did not start his ministry that way! Rather, his capacity over time was magnified as he learned to abide in and walk with the Son of God." — [Elder David A. Bednar, "Abide in Me, and I in You; Therefore Walk with Me," April 2023](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2023/04/57bednar.md)

### Anointed Eyes (Moses 6:35–36)

Immediately after the "walk with me" invitation comes one of the most striking verses in all scripture:

> "Anoint thine eyes with clay, and wash them, and thou shalt see. And he did so. And he beheld the spirits that God had created; and he beheld also things which were not visible to the natural eye; and from thenceforth came the saying abroad in the land: A seer hath the Lord raised up unto his people." — [Moses 6:35–36](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)

The footnote to "clay" points to [John 9:6](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/john/9.md) — when Jesus put clay on the blind man's eyes and told him to wash. The parallel is intentional. Walking with God opens our eyes to see what is invisible to the natural eye. When we accept His invitation, our perception of reality shifts — we begin to see as He sees.

President Eyring shared an experience of this very gift in his "Walk with Me" talk — when, as a bishop, the Lord showed him a wayward member as God saw him: *"I'm going to let you see him as I see him."* And Enoch was the first recorded seer in scripture.

## II. Enoch's Arc: From Lad to Zion-Builder

### The World Enoch Lived In

Enoch stepped into a world that sounds uncomfortably like our own:

> "Satan had great dominion among men, and raged in their hearts; and from thenceforth came wars and bloodshed; and a man's hand was against his own brother, in administering death, because of **secret works, seeking for power.**" — [Moses 6:15](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)

Wars. Bloodshed. Secret combinations. Brother against brother. *Seeking for power.* This is the backdrop against which a young, hated, slow-of-speech man was called to build the most righteous civilization in human history.

### The Transformation

Look at what happened after Enoch accepted the call:

- **People trembled** and could not stand in his presence ([Moses 6:47](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md))
- His **faith was so great** that he led the people of God against armies, the earth trembled, mountains fled, rivers turned from their course ([Moses 7:13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md))
- A land rose **out of the depth of the sea** to swallow their enemies ([Moses 7:14](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md))
- Enemies "stood afar off" in fear ([Moses 7:15](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md))
- **The Lord came and dwelt with his people** ([Moses 7:16](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md))

From "I'm just a kid and everyone hates me" to *mountains fleeing before him*. That is the arc of what happens when someone truly walks with God.

Virginia H. Pearce made a crucial observation:

> "The people of the city of Enoch are remembered by us as so good—so incredibly good—that the whole city was taken up into heaven. But if we read carefully we see that the city of Zion was taken up into heaven '**in process of time**'" — [Virginia H. Pearce, "Keep Walking, and Give Time a Chance," April 1997](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/1997/04/keep-walking-and-give-time-a-chance.md)

*In process of time.* [Moses 7:21](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md). Not overnight. Not in a single miraculous moment. Over 365 years of daily walking with God ([Moses 7:68](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)).

---

## III. Building Zion: The Definition

### What Zion Is

> "And the Lord called his people **Zion**, because they were of **one heart and one mind**, and dwelt in **righteousness**; and there was **no poor among them.**" — [Moses 7:18](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)

Four elements. Three conditions and a name:

1. **One heart** — unified in love and desire
2. **One mind** — unified in understanding and purpose  
3. **Dwelt in righteousness** — lived according to celestial law
4. **No poor among them** — complete material care for each other

The Lord later said plainly: **"For this is Zion—the pure in heart"** ([D&C 97:21](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/97.md)).

Elder Christofferson in his landmark talk "Come to Zion" identified what we must do to build Zion today:

> "Zion is Zion because of the character, attributes, and faithfulness of her citizens. ... If we would establish Zion in our homes, branches, wards, and stakes, we must rise to this standard. It will be necessary (1) to become unified in one heart and one mind; (2) to become, individually and collectively, a holy people; and (3) to care for the poor and needy with such effectiveness that we eliminate poverty among us. **We cannot wait until Zion comes for these things to happen — Zion will come only as they happen.**" — [Elder D. Todd Christofferson, "Come to Zion," October 2008](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2008/10/come-to-zion.md)

That last sentence is the key: Zion doesn't descend upon us while we passively wait. It forms *as we become Zion people.*

### What Zion Is NOT

The early Saints tried to establish Zion in Missouri — and failed. The Lord's diagnosis was devastating:

> "They have not learned to be obedient to the things which I required at their hands, but are full of all manner of evil, and do not impart of their substance, as becometh saints, to the poor and afflicted among them; and are not united according to the union required by the law of the celestial kingdom." — [D&C 105:3–4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.md)

And more specifically:

> "There were jarrings, and contentions, and envyings, and strifes, and lustful and covetous desires among them; therefore by these things they polluted their inheritances." — [D&C 101:6](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.md)

Zion cannot be built by those who contend with each other, who covet, who fail to care for the poor. **Geography doesn't make Zion. Character does.**

### Zion Has Been Built Before

Enoch's people achieved it. But so did others:

**The Nephite Zion** (4 Nephi):

> "There was no contention in the land, because of the **love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people.** And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a **happier people** among all the people who had been created by the hand of God." — [4 Nephi 1:15–16](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.md)

> "They were in **one**, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God." — [4 Nephi 1:17](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.md)

Note the language: "in one." Not Nephites, not Lamanites — no "-ites" at all. Just *one*. The key ingredient in both Enoch's Zion and the Nephite Zion was the same: the love of God dwelling in their hearts.

And both eventually faced the same threat: pride, class division, and the building of churches "to get gain" ([4 Nephi 1:24–26](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.md)). The Nephite Zion lasted about 200 years before it fell. Enoch's lasted 365 years before it was taken up.

---

## IV. The Weeping God: Enoch Who Comforted Heaven (Moses 7:28–41)

This may be the most theologically staggering passage in all of scripture. After Zion is taken up, Enoch sees the rest of humanity spiraling into wickedness. And then:

> "The God of heaven looked upon the residue of the people, and he **wept**; and Enoch bore record of it, saying: How is it that the heavens weep, and shed forth their tears as the rain upon the mountains?" — [Moses 7:28](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)

Enoch is *stunned*. He asks the question we would all ask:

> "How is it that thou canst **weep**, seeing thou art holy, and from all eternity to all eternity? ... And thy curtains are stretched out still; and yet thou art there, and thy bosom is there; and also thou art just; thou art merciful and kind forever ... how is it thou canst weep?" — [Moses 7:29–31](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)

The God who holds millions of earths in His hands. The God whose throne is founded on peace, justice, and truth. *This* God weeps?

His answer reveals the heart of the Father:

> "Behold these thy brethren; they are the **workmanship of mine own hands**, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in the day I created them; and in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his **agency**; and unto thy brethren have I said, and also given commandment, that they should **love** one another, and that they should **choose me**, their Father; but behold, they are without affection, and they **hate** their own blood." — [Moses 7:32–33](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)

God wept because His children chose hate when He had given them every capacity and commandment to love. His weeping is *parental* grief — not the distant sorrow of a cosmic administrator but the anguished love of a Father whose children destroy themselves.

### Enoch Enters God's Sorrow

And here is the moment: *Enoch's response.* He doesn't lecture. He doesn't theologize. He enters in:

> "Enoch knew, and looked upon their wickedness, and their misery, and wept and stretched forth his arms, and his **heart swelled wide as eternity**; and his **bowels yearned**; and all eternity shook." — [Moses 7:41](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)

A man whose heart *swelled wide as eternity*. Who felt what God felt. Who wept **with** God.

> "I will refuse to be comforted." — [Moses 7:44](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)

Enoch didn't just comfort God — he became a **companion in grief**. He saw what God saw, felt what God felt, and refused to look away. *This* is what it means to walk with God at the deepest level. Not just obedience. Not just power. But entering into God's own emotional experience of creation.

And God's gentle response: *"Lift up your heart, and be glad; and look."* Then He shows Enoch the coming of the Son of Man, the Atonement, the Resurrection, and the eventual return of Zion. The comfort God offers to Enoch — and to us — is not that suffering will disappear, but that it has a purpose and an end.

---

## V. The New Jerusalem: The Promise and the Preparation (Moses 7:62–64)

After showing Enoch the whole sweep of history — the flood, the tower, the scattering, the Crucifixion, the Apostasy, the Restoration — the Lord makes a breathtaking promise:

> "Righteousness will I send down out of heaven; and truth will I send forth out of the earth, to bear testimony of mine Only Begotten; his resurrection from the dead; yea, and also the resurrection of all men; and righteousness and truth will I cause to sweep the earth as with a flood, **to gather out mine elect from the four quarters of the earth, unto a place which I shall prepare, an Holy City**, that my people may gird up their loins, and be looking forth for the time of my coming; for there shall be my tabernacle, and it shall be called **Zion, a New Jerusalem.**" — [Moses 7:62](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)

And then the *reunion*:

> "Then shalt **thou and all thy city meet them there**, and we will receive them into our bosom, and they shall see us; and we will **fall upon their necks**, and they shall **fall upon our necks**, and we will **kiss each other**." — [Moses 7:63](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)

What a picture. The city of Enoch, which was taken up thousands of years ago, returns to embrace the New Jerusalem. Mutual embrace — "*we will fall upon their necks, and they shall fall upon our necks.*" Two Zion peoples meeting across millennia.

D&C 45 adds more detail about this gathering place:

> "And it shall be called the New Jerusalem, **a land of peace, a city of refuge, a place of safety** for the saints of the Most High God; and the glory of the Lord shall be there ... insomuch that the wicked will not come unto it, and it shall be called Zion." — [D&C 45:66–67](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.md)

> "And it shall come to pass among the wicked, that every man that **will not take his sword against his neighbor** must needs flee unto Zion for safety." — [D&C 45:68](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.md)

This is your longing made scripture. Those who refuse to fight against their neighbors will *flee to Zion*. The gathering is not just for the righteous — it is for the *peaceful*. For those who, in a world tearing itself apart, say "I will not raise my hand against my brother."

> "And there shall be gathered unto it out of every nation under heaven; and it shall be **the only people that shall not be at war one with another.**" — [D&C 45:69](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.md)

---

## VI. How Do I Live Like Enoch? Entering the Millennium Now

You asked the essential questions: *How do I live like Enoch? How do I build Zion? How do I get my family to live a Zion-like life? How do I enter the millennium now?*

### 1. Accept the Invitation Broken

Enoch didn't come to his calling polished. He came young, hated, slow of speech. President Freeman taught:

> "Don't let your condition hinder you. Remember, pace or placement on the path are not as important as progress. ... It doesn't matter your age or your condition. You can walk with Him." — [President Emily Belle Freeman, "Walking in Covenant Relationship with Christ," October 2023](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2023/10/42freeman.md)

Her image of walking the Jesus Trail with a broken ankle and a knee scooter — being pulled along by a guide who tied a rope to her — is the perfect picture of covenant relationship. We don't walk perfectly. We walk *with Him*, and He pulls us through the hard parts.

### 2. Let God Open Your Eyes

The clay-and-wash experience of [Moses 6:35](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md) is more than a miracle. It is a pattern. When we walk with God, He changes our vision. We begin to see:
- The spirits that God created — the divine worth of every person
- Things not visible to the natural eye — eternal perspective, spiritual realities
- What God sees when He looks at His children — as President Eyring experienced with his ward member

This is practical: the next time you look at a difficult neighbor, a struggling family member, a political opponent — ask God to let you see them as He sees them.

### 3. Build Zion in Your Home First

Elder Stone nailed the principle:

> "Wherever we are, whatever city we may live in, we can build our own Zion by the principles of the celestial kingdom and ever seek to become the pure in heart. Zion is the beautiful, and the Lord holds it in His own hands. **Our homes can be places which are a refuge and protection, as Zion is.**" — [Elder David R. Stone, "Zion in the Midst of Babylon," April 2006](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2006/04/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.md)

He gave the image of the Manhattan Temple — built inside an existing building, connected to the outer walls at only a few points. The temple was silent inside even though New York City roared outside. *That is how you build Zion within Babylon: limit the contact points.*

**For your family, the Moses 7:18 checklist:**

| Zion Attribute | Family Application |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **One heart** | Family council. Unified goals. No one left behind emotionally. Pray together and mean it. |
| **One mind** | Study together. Discuss doctrine openly. Build shared understanding of what matters. |
| **Dwelt in righteousness** | Sabbath observance. Temple attendance. Covenant keeping. Personal repentance as daily practice. |
| **No poor among them** | No child goes without attention. No spouse goes without support. Temporal and emotional needs met within the family before outside. |

### 4. Refuse to Take Up the Sword

Your specific situation — living in Missouri, sensing the call, not wanting to fight against your neighbors — resonates directly with [D&C 45:68](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.md): "every man that will not take his sword against his neighbor must needs flee unto Zion for safety."

You don't have to wait for the New Jerusalem to be built to live this way. *You can be a Zion person now.* The early Saints failed in Missouri not because of geography but because of character ([D&C 105:3–4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.md)). The lesson: the *place* will be prepared when the *people* are ready.

President Romney observed:

> "Remember that Enoch's Zion was built in a day when wickedness was as rampant as it is among us today. Among those who rejected the word of God in that day 'there were wars and bloodshed'; they were ripening in that iniquity which brought the flood. 'But the Lord came and dwelt with his people.'" — [President Marion G. Romney, "Church Welfare Services' Basic Principles," April 1976](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/1976/04/church-welfare-services-basic-principles.md)

The surrounding wickedness didn't prevent Zion. It made Zion *necessary*.

### 5. Enter the Millennium in Your Heart

Elder Uchtdorf taught:

> "Enoch and his people lived in a time of wickedness, wars, and bloodshed. 'But the Lord came and dwelt with his people.' He had something **unimaginable** in mind for them. He helped them establish Zion — a people 'of one heart and one mind' who 'dwelt in righteousness.'" — [Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf, "God Will Do Something Unimaginable," October 2020](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2020/10/28uchtdorf.md)

The millennium is not merely a calendar event. It is a *condition*:

> "For the space of a thousand years the **earth shall rest.**" — [Moses 7:64](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)

> "And the Lord shall be in their midst, and his glory shall be upon them, and he will be their king and their lawgiver." — [D&C 45:59](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.md)

You enter the millennium by letting the Lord be in your midst *now*. By inviting Him to be the king and lawgiver of your home. By being one heart and one mind with your family. By caring for the poor among you. By refusing to contend.

The 4 Nephi people give us the result: *"Surely there could not be a **happier** people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God"* ([4 Nephi 1:16](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.md)). That happiness was not from wealth or ease — it was from the **love of God dwelling in their hearts** ([4 Nephi 1:15](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.md)).

---

## VII. Enoch's Priesthood Lineage: The Chain of Fathers

One detail easily missed: Enoch was part of a priesthood chain that went back to Adam himself:

> "Enoch was twenty-five years old when he was ordained under the hand of Adam; and he was sixty-five and Adam blessed him. And he saw the Lord, and he walked with him, and was before his face continually; and he **walked with God three hundred and sixty-five years**, making him four hundred and thirty years old when he was translated." — [D&C 107:48–49](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.md)

Adam ordained Enoch. Adam blessed Enoch. Jared "taught Enoch in all the ways of God" ([Moses 6:21](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)). Enoch came from **a family that taught their children the ways of God.**

And what did God command Adam to do? The same thing we are commanded:

> "Therefore I give unto you a commandment, to **teach these things freely unto your children.**" — [Moses 6:58](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)

This is the Come, Follow Me lesson title for this week. It is not an accident that the 2026 youth theme comes from the same chapter. The Lord is teaching us: **the path to Zion runs through the family.** Adam taught Seth. Seth taught Enos. Jared taught Enoch. And Enoch built Zion. Each generation carried the fire forward.

Three years before Adam's death, he gathered "Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, and Methuselah, who were all high priests, with the residue of his posterity who were righteous, into the valley of **Adam-ondi-Ahman**" ([D&C 107:53](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.md)). And the Lord appeared to them. This was the first great family gathering of the priesthood — and Enoch was there.

---

## VIII. Hebrews 11: The Faith Hall of Fame

> "By faith Enoch was **translated** that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that **he pleased God.**" — [Hebrews 11:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/heb/11.md)

And then the verse that defines the whole enterprise:

> "But without **faith** it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that **he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.**" — [Hebrews 11:6](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/heb/11.md)

Enoch *pleased* God. Not perfectly from the start — he grew into it over 365 years. But the testimony that preceded his translation was simple: he pleased God.

The Lectures on Faith (this project's `books/lecture-on-faith/` collection) teach that three things are necessary for the exercise of faith in God:
1. The *idea* that God exists
2. A correct *idea of his character, perfections, and attributes*
3. An *actual knowledge* that one's course of life is according to God's will

Enoch had all three — and Moses 7 is a masterclass in each. He knew God existed (he saw Him face to face in [Moses 7:4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)). He learned God's character from the weeping-God exchange. And he walked with God for 365 years until his life was so aligned that translation was the natural result.

---

## IX. For Me: Walking Now

I am in Missouri. I feel called here. I look for the New Jerusalem. I do not want to fight my neighbor.

Enoch teaches me:

1. **Start broken.** My weaknesses are not disqualifiers — they are the starting conditions for every prophet God has ever called.
2. **Walk daily.** Three hundred and sixty-five years of daily faithfulness, not one dramatic moment. "In process of time."
3. **See with anointed eyes.** Ask God to show me what He sees. In my neighbors. In my family. In myself.
4. **Weep with God.** Enter His empathy. Let my heart swell wide as eternity. Refuse to look away from suffering.
5. **Build Zion in my home.** One heart. One mind. Righteousness. No poor. Start there.
6. **Refuse the sword.** In words, in actions, in social media, in politics. Be the person who will not take up arms against his neighbor.
7. **Teach these things freely.** To my children. To the rising generation. The fire passes through families.
8. **Trust the process of time.** Zion was not built in a day. Neither will mine be. "Keep walking, and give time a chance."

The invitation hasn't changed since Enoch heard it on the hills:

> **"Walk with me."**
