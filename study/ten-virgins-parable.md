# The Parable of the Ten Virgins

*A comparative study across 2025 General Conference and scripture*

---

## The Original Parable

### Matthew 25:1-13

> **1.** Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
>
> **2.** And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
>
> **3.** They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
>
> **4.** But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
>
> **5.** While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
>
> **6.** And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.
>
> **7.** Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
>
> **8.** And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
>
> **9.** But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
>
> **10.** And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.
>
> **11.** Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
>
> **12.** But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
>
> **13.** Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.

## Doctrine and Covenants Commentary

### D&C 33:17 — The Preparation Command

> "Wherefore, be faithful, praying always, having your **lamps trimmed and burning, and oil with you**, that you may be ready at the coming of the Bridegroom."

— [D&C 33:17](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/33.md)

This is a direct command to be ready. The language echoes the parable: lamps trimmed, oil prepared.

### D&C 45:56-57 — The Interpretation

> **56.** And at that day, when I shall come in my glory, shall the parable be fulfilled which I spake concerning the ten virgins.
>
> **57.** For **they that are wise and have received the truth, and have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide**, and have not been deceived—verily I say unto you, they shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire, but shall abide the day.

— [D&C 45:56-57](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.md)

**This is the Lord's own interpretation.** The wise virgins are those who:
1. Have **received the truth**
2. Have **taken the Holy Spirit for their guide**
3. Have **not been deceived**

## Key Teaching: Oil = Conversion, Lamp = Testimony

### Elder David A. Bednar's Framework (October 2012)

In his foundational talk ["Converted unto the Lord"](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2012/10/converted-unto-the-lord.md), Elder Bednar offered this interpretation:

> "I now want to use one of many possible interpretations of the parable of the ten virgins to highlight the relationship between testimony and conversion. Ten virgins, five who were wise and five who were foolish, took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. **Please think of the lamps used by the virgins as the lamps of testimony. The foolish virgins took their lamps of testimony but took no oil with them. Consider the oil to be the oil of conversion.**"

He explains the critical difference:

> "Testimony is the beginning of and a prerequisite to continuing conversion. Testimony is a point of departure; it is not an ultimate destination. Strong testimony is the foundation upon which conversion is established.
>
> **Testimony alone is not and will not be enough to protect us in the latter-day storm of darkness and evil in which we are living.** Testimony is important and necessary but not sufficient to provide the spiritual strength and protection we need. Some members of the Church with testimonies have wavered and fallen away."

### Why Oil Cannot Be Borrowed

Elder Bednar asks:

> "Were the five wise virgins selfish and unwilling to share, or were they indicating correctly that **the oil of conversion cannot be borrowed**? Can the spiritual strength that results from consistent obedience to the commandments be given to another person? Can the knowledge obtained through diligent study and pondering of the scriptures be conveyed to one who is in need? Can the peace the gospel brings to a faithful Latter-day Saint be transferred to an individual experiencing adversity or great challenge? The clear answer to each of these questions is **no**."

### How Oil Is Acquired

> "This precious oil is acquired **one drop at a time**—'line upon line [and] precept upon precept' ([2 Nephi 28:30](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.md)), patiently and persistently. **No shortcut is available; no last-minute flurry of preparation is possible.**"

## April 2025: President Camille N. Johnson

### "Spiritually Whole in Him"

[Full talk](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/04/14johnson.md)

President Johnson builds on Elder Bednar's framework and adds crucial insights:

#### The Virgins' Identity

> "Consider that **all ten virgins chose the covenant path**. All were invited to the wedding feast. All carried lamps. They all went out to meet the bridegroom. Then they all slumbered and slept... All woke and trimmed their lamps.
>
> But only the wise virgins filled their vessels with oil."

**Key observation:** The foolish virgins weren't outsiders—they were covenant members who simply lacked sufficient oil (conversion).

#### What Made the Difference

> "The lamp, by one interpretation, represents **testimony**, and the oil in the vessels represents the **oil of conversion**. Testimony is the flame. Conversion is the fuel."

She adds a profound layer:

> "We can know that the Lord is the Christ. But **do we know Him?** This is the essence of conversion. It is what mattered at the moment the bridegroom appeared at the door."

#### Why "I Know You Not"

The bridegroom's devastating response—"I know you not"—is explained through relationship:

> "The wise virgins didn't just know *about* the bridegroom. **They knew Him.** Their oil represented a deep, personal relationship with the Savior built through covenant keeping, through sacrifice, through coming to know His voice."

The foolish virgins had testimony (the flame) but lacked the intimate knowledge of Christ that comes through conversion (the oil).

#### The Sculpture on Temple Square

President Johnson announced a new sculpture:

> "A beautiful new work of art titled *Five Wise Virgins* will soon be placed on Temple Square... As you view this sculpture, may you be reminded of the precious oil of conversion—**oil that cannot be borrowed, oil that is acquired one drop at a time**."

#### How We Fill Our Lamps

> "When we make and keep covenants with God—when we bind ourselves to Him—we fill our lamps with the oil of conversion... Every time we partake of the sacrament with real intent, we add oil. Every time we serve with no thought of recognition, we add oil. Every time we forgive when it's hard, we add oil. Every time we study the scriptures and hear His voice, we add oil."

---

## The Central Question

President Johnson frames the parable around one penetrating question:

> "The question is not: Do we have a testimony?
>
> The question is: **Are we converted?**
>
> Do we *know* the gospel is true? Or do we *know Him* who is the Truth?"

---

## October 2025: Second Coming Preparation Themes

While October 2025 General Conference did not feature a direct talk on the ten virgins parable, several talks addressed the broader theme of preparing for Christ's return.

### President Russell M. Nelson (October 2024)

In ["The Lord Jesus Christ Will Come Again"](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2024/10/57nelson.md), President Nelson sets the urgency:

> "I am calling upon you to prepare for the Second Coming of the Lord Jesus Christ... We need to be ready. The time is now. There is no time to waste."

He gave specific counsel:
- "Increase your faith in Jesus Christ"
- "Spend more time in the temple"
- "Become a true disciple of Jesus Christ"

### Elder David A. Bednar (October 2025)

In ["They Are Their Own Judges"](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/10/51bednar.md), Elder Bednar teaches that for the righteous, the Final Judgment will be a "pleasing" experience—those who have converted unto the Lord will recognize Him and be recognized by Him.

This connects directly to the parable: the wise virgins were known by the bridegroom because they knew Him.

---

## Synthesis: What the Parable Teaches Us

### 1. Covenant Membership Is Not Enough

All ten virgins were part of the wedding party. All had lamps (testimony). The difference was internal—the oil of conversion that can only be acquired personally.

**Application:** Church activity, callings, and even public testimony are not sufficient. The question is whether we are being *converted* unto the Lord.

### 2. Oil Cannot Be Borrowed in Crisis

When the cry came at midnight, there was no time to borrow, no time to prepare. The wise virgins couldn't share—not because they were selfish, but because conversion cannot be transferred.

**Application:** We cannot rely on a spouse's faith, a parent's testimony, or a ward's spiritual strength. Our personal relationship with Christ is ours alone to develop.

### 3. Oil Is Acquired Drop by Drop

> "This precious oil is acquired one drop at a time—line upon line and precept upon precept, patiently and persistently. No shortcut is available; no last-minute flurry of preparation is possible."
> — Elder Bednar

**Application:** Daily discipleship matters. Small acts of faith, repeated over time, fill our vessels.

### 4. The Wise Virgins Knew the Bridegroom

The foolish virgins cried, "Lord, Lord, open to us." But the bridegroom said, "I know you not." They knew *about* Him, but they did not *know* Him.

**Application:** The goal isn't just testimony—it's relationship. Do we know His voice? Do we recognize His hand? Does He know us?

### 5. The Holy Spirit Is Our Guide

From D&C 45:57, the wise are those who "have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide, and have not been deceived."

**Application:** The oil of conversion is connected to following the Spirit. Those who have the Holy Ghost as a constant companion are developing the conversion that will enable them to "abide the day."

## Filling Our Lamps: Practical Actions

From President Johnson's counsel, oil is added through:

| Action | How It Adds Oil |
|--------|-----------------|
| Partaking of the sacrament with real intent | Renews covenants, deepens commitment |
| Service without recognition | Develops Christlike love |
| Forgiving when it's hard | Transforms our nature |
| Scripture study where we hear His voice | Builds personal relationship |
| Temple worship | Makes and keeps sacred covenants |
| Receiving and following the Holy Ghost | The defining characteristic of the wise (D&C 45:57) |

---

## Questions for Reflection

1. **Testimony vs. Conversion:** Do I have a testimony about Christ, or am I being converted *to* Him? Is my faith intellectual knowledge or lived relationship?

2. **The Holy Spirit as Guide:** How consistently do I follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost? Am I taking Him as my guide?

3. **Drop by Drop:** What am I doing *daily* to add oil to my lamp? What small, consistent practices am I engaged in?

4. **Borrowed Faith:** In what areas am I relying on someone else's spiritual strength rather than developing my own?

5. **Knowing Him:** If the Savior came tonight, would He know me? Would I know His voice?

Remarkably, **April 2025 General Conference featured the parable of the ten virgins as a recurring theme** across multiple talks. President Oaks noted: "His parable of the ten virgins, spoken of so frequently in this conference, suggests that of those invited to meet Him, only half will be prepared."

## Additional Insights from Recent Talks

### Elder Renlund: Three Elements of Wisdom (April 2025)

Elder Renlund emphasized that Jesus Himself identified **three aspects** of the parable in D&C 45:56-57:

> "If we are wise, we **receive the truth** by accepting the gospel of Jesus Christ through priesthood ordinances and covenants. Next, we strive to remain worthy of having **the Holy Ghost always with us**. This capability must be acquired individually and personally, drop by drop. Consistent, personal, private acts of devotion invite the Holy Ghost to guide us.
>
> The third element that Jesus highlighted is **avoiding deception**."

He connects oil-gathering to **private devotion**:
> "Consistent, personal, private acts of devotion invite the Holy Ghost to guide us."

And provides comfort for the anxious:
> "The best advice for her, for you, and for me is to follow the Savior's teachings. His instructions are neither mysterious nor complex. When we follow them, **we do not need to fear or be anxious**."

---

### Elder Rasband: What Fills Our Lamps (April 2023)

Elder Rasband provides a practical list of what produces oil:

> "Oil comes from **believing and acting on prophecy and the words of living prophets**, President Nelson in particular, his counselors, and the Twelve Apostles. Oil fills our souls when we **hear and feel the Holy Ghost and act on that divine guidance**. Oil pours into our hearts when **our choices show we love the Lord and we love what He loves**. Oil comes from **repenting and seeking the healing of the Atonement** of Jesus Christ."

He warns against "a thin skiff of oil":
> "I fear there are some who are just getting by on a thin skiff of oil, too busy with worldly pressures to properly prepare."

---

### Sister Amy Wright: "We Needed Every Drop" (October 2023)

Sister Wright's cancer diagnosis becomes a profound illustration:

> "In my mind I asked Heavenly Father, 'Am I going to die?' The Holy Ghost whispered, 'Everything is going to be OK.' Then I asked, 'Am I going to live?' Again, the answer came: 'Everything is going to be OK.'
>
> I was confused. Why did I receive the exact same answer whether I lived or died?"

The answer came: because her family was prepared.

> "**It was too late to put oil in our lamps. We needed every single drop, and we needed it right now!**"

She adds a powerful distinction:
> "We cannot share our oil, but we can share *His* light."

---

### Elder Pearson: Why the Foolish Virgins Failed (October 2022)

Elder Pearson offers insight into *why* the foolish virgins were deceived:

> "What about the foolish virgins? Why were they unwilling to carry a vessel of spiritual oil? Did they simply procrastinate? They were perhaps too casual because it was inconvenient or seemed unnecessary. Whatever the reason, **they were deceived about the crucial role of Christ**. This is Satan's fundamental deception and why their lamps of testimony eventually went out for lack of spiritual oil."

A sobering observation:
> "**Many leave the Savior and their covenants long before they leave His Church.**"

He connects the parable to "carnal security":
> "Carnal security is seeking for and trusting in worldly things instead of Christ—in other words, looking through a secular lens instead of a spiritual lens."

---

## Summary

The Parable of the Ten Virgins is about *conversion*, not just *testimony*. The lamp represents our testimony—our knowledge that Jesus is the Christ. The oil represents our conversion—our personal, covenant relationship with Him built through daily discipleship.

All ten virgins were on the covenant path. All had lamps. The difference was the oil—and oil cannot be borrowed at midnight.

The Lord's own interpretation in D&C 45:57 identifies the wise as those who:
- Have **received the truth**
- Have **taken the Holy Spirit for their guide**
- Have **not been deceived**

The haunting words "I know you not" come because the foolish virgins knew *about* the bridegroom but did not *know* Him. Conversion creates relationship. And relationship is what matters when He comes.

> "The question is not: Do we have a testimony? The question is: Are we converted? Do we know the gospel is true? Or do we know Him who is the Truth?"
> — President Camille N. Johnson, April 2025
