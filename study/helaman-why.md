# Why Did Mormon Include This?

*Reading Helaman 1 through 3 Nephi 11, asking President Benson's question at every chapter.*

---

## Origin

This study comes from the "Become" section of [Elder Bednar's October 2024 talk study](talks/202410-35bednar.md). The assignment was simple: read Helaman asking one question — **"Why did Mormon include this?"** — and then extend through 3 Nephi 11 when Christ appears at the temple in Bountiful.

The framework comes from Elder Bednar, who quoted President Benson:

> "In the Book of Mormon we find a pattern for preparing for the Second Coming. A major portion of the book centers on the few decades just prior to Christ's coming to America. By analogy, the book of Helaman corresponds to our day."

The method: read for **patterns, not predictions**. Apply **inward, not outward**. Ask at each chapter: *Why did Mormon, writing for our day, choose to preserve this?*

## Chapter by Chapter

### Helaman 1 — Complacency Loses the Capital

*Pahoran dies. His three sons contend for the judgment seat. Kishkumen murders Pahoran II. Coriantumr — a Nephite dissenter — leads a Lamanite army straight to Zarahemla and takes it.*

**Why did Mormon include this?** Because the capital didn't fall to a superior force. It fell because the Nephites "had not kept sufficient guards in the land of Zarahemla; for they had supposed that the Lamanites durst not come into the heart of their lands to attack that great city" ([Helaman 1:18](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/1.md)).

They *supposed*. They assumed. The enemy they feared was outside, but the man who led the attack — Coriantumr — was a Nephite dissenter. The threat came from within, leveraging their complacency.

**Pattern for our day:** The most dangerous spiritual threats are not the ones we expect from outside. They are the assumptions we make about what "can't happen" — the guards we stop posting because we feel safe.

---

### Helaman 2 — The Craft of Words

*Gadianton is introduced. "Exceedingly expert in many words, and also in his craft, to carry on the secret work of murder and of robbery" ([Helaman 2:4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/2.md)). He flatters his followers with promises of "power and authority." Kishkumen is killed, but Gadianton's band escapes to the wilderness.*

Mormon tips his editorial hand: "And behold, in the end of this book ye shall see that this Gadianton did prove the overthrow, yea, almost the entire destruction of the people of Nephi" ([Helaman 2:13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/2.md)).

**Why did Mormon include this?** To show us what to watch for. Gadianton's primary tool is not violence — it's *words*. He is "expert in many words." He persuades. He flatters. He promises power. The violence comes later, but the entry point is always rhetoric.

**Pattern for our day:** Watch for the craft of words. Not all persuasive speech is evil, but when someone is "expert in many words" and the words lead to promises of power and authority, Mormon is telling us to recognize the pattern.

---

### Helaman 3 — Pride Enters the Church

*Many migrate northward. The church grows. Then pride enters — not from outside, but from within.*

"The pride of the church... because of the exceedingly great riches and their prosperity in the land; and it did grow upon them from day to day" ([Helaman 3:36](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/3.md)).

Yet a faithful remnant: "they did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ" ([Helaman 3:35](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/3.md)).

**Why did Mormon include this?** Because the pride isn't in "the world" — it's in "the church." The institution isn't corrupt; individual hearts are. And the antidote is personal: fasting, prayer, humility. Not institutional reform. Personal conversion, growing "stronger and stronger" and "firmer and firmer."

---

### Helaman 4 — The Cost of Boasting

*The Nephites lose half their territory. Mormon explains why:*

"It was because of the pride of their hearts, because of their exceeding riches, yea, it was because of their oppression to the poor, withholding their food from the hungry, withholding their clothing from the naked, and smiting their humble brethren upon the cheek, making a mock of that which was sacred, denying the spirit of prophecy and of revelation" ([Helaman 4:12](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/4.md)).

Then the critical verse: "They saw that they had become weak, like unto their brethren, the Lamanites, and that the Spirit of the Lord did no more preserve them; yea, it had withdrawn from them because the Spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples" ([Helaman 4:24](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/4.md)).

And: "they had altered and trampled under their feet the laws of Mosiah... and this they did in the space of not many years" ([Helaman 4:22](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/4.md)).

**Why did Mormon include this?** For the speed. "In the space of not many years" — the phrase Elder Bednar built his entire talk around. The Nephites didn't wake up one morning and decide to become wicked. Pride crept in. The Spirit withdrew quietly. Their strength left before they noticed it was gone.

**Pattern for our day:** "The Spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples." This isn't about buildings. It's about us — our individual temples. And the withdrawal is silent. We don't feel it leave. We only notice later that our strength is gone.

---

### Helaman 5 — The Rock, the Voice, and the Fire

*Nephi gives up the judgment seat because the laws are corrupted by the majority. He and his brother Lehi go preach. Their father Helaman had charged them:*

> "Remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall." ([Helaman 5:12](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.md))

Then the prison miracle: Nephi and Lehi are encircled by fire. A cloud of darkness overshadows their captors. A voice: "a still voice of perfect mildness, as if it had been a whisper, and it did pierce even to the very soul" ([Helaman 5:30](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.md)). Three hundred people are converted. The Lamanites "did yield up... the lands of their possession" voluntarily ([Helaman 5:52](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.md)).

**Why did Mormon include this?** This is the foundation chapter for the entire narrative. Everything that follows — every fall, every destruction, every cycle — makes sense against this backdrop. The Nephites had the rock. They knew about it. Helaman *taught it to his sons by name.* And yet the nation still fell.

The prison miracle also foreshadows 3 Nephi: fire, darkness, a voice, conversion. The small-scale version happens here. The national-scale version happens at Christ's coming. The same elements. The question is whether people are ready to hear the still small voice when it comes.

**Pattern for our day:** Knowing the doctrine isn't enough. Helaman's sons *knew* the rock. They built on it. But most of the nation heard the same teaching and didn't build. The rock is available to everyone. Building on it is individual.

---

### Helaman 6 — The Great Reversal

*The Lamanites become "exceedingly righteous" while the Nephites grow wicked. The mechanism:*

Lamanites: "The Spirit of the Lord began to withdraw from the Nephites, because of the wickedness and the hardness of their hearts. And it came to pass that the Spirit of the Lord began to pour out upon the Lamanites, because of their easiness and willingness to believe in his words" ([Helaman 6:35–36](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/6.md)).

Meanwhile, the Gadianton robbers "did obtain the sole management of the government" among the Nephites ([Helaman 6:39](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/6.md)).

**Why did Mormon include this?** To destroy the assumption that covenant status protects you. The Nephites — the covenant people — fall. The Lamanites — the ones everyone would have written off — rise. Not because the Lamanites are genetically or culturally superior, but because of "easiness and willingness to believe."

The reversal is the point. Institutional belonging means nothing if the individual heart is hard. And "easiness and willingness to believe" — what a phrase. Not complexity of theology. Not intellectual sophistication. Simple willingness.

---

### Helaman 7 — The Garden Tower Prayer

*Nephi prays on his garden tower, mourning the wickedness. People gather. He confronts them directly: "Ye have set your hearts upon the riches and the vain things of this world" ([Helaman 7:21](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/7.md)).*

He tells them the Lamanites are now more righteous, and he wishes he had lived in the days of Nephi of old, "when my people were easy to be entreated, were firm to keep the commandments of God, and were slow to be led to do iniquity" ([Helaman 7:7](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/7.md)).

**Why did Mormon include this?** For the public confrontation. Nephi doesn't pray privately and leave it there. He names the disease openly: hearts set on riches. And the phrase "easy to be entreated" — the opposite of hard-hearted. The early Nephites were teachable. These Nephites are not.

**Pattern for our day:** Am I "easy to be entreated"? When correction comes — from the Spirit, from leaders, from scripture — do I receive it? Or do I rationalize, argue, explain it away?

---

### Helaman 8 — Every Prophet Testified of Christ

*The Gadianton judges try to incite the crowd against Nephi. He responds with a sweeping testimony: Moses, Abraham, Zenos, Zenock, Ezias, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lehi — all testified of Christ. Then he reveals that their chief judge has been murdered by his own brother, both members of the secret band.*

**Why did Mormon include this?** To show what the prophetic witness actually looks like. Nephi doesn't just share feelings. He grounds his testimony in the chain of witnesses across all dispensations. Every prophet testified of Christ. Nephi is in that chain. And the proof of his prophetic calling? He reveals hidden truth that only God could have shown him.

---

### Helaman 9 — The Proof and the Division

*Five men run to verify Nephi's claim. They find the dead chief judge. They're accused of murder themselves. Nephi reveals Seantum as the killer. Some accept Nephi as prophet. Others call him a god. Most just walk away.*

**Why did Mormon include this?** For the division. Even with undeniable prophetic proof — a murder revealed in real time — the response splits three ways: faith, misdirected worship, and indifference. The same evidence, three different responses. The variable isn't the evidence. It's the heart.

---

### Helaman 10 — Unwearyingness

*Nephi walks home pondering. God's voice comes: "Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those things which thou hast done; for I have beheld how thou hast with unwearyingness declared the word, which I have given unto thee, unto this people. And thou hast not feared them, and hast not sought thine own life, but hast sought my will, and to keep my commandments" ([Helaman 10:4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/10.md)).*

God gives Nephi sealing power — with this condition: "thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will" ([Helaman 10:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/10.md)).

**Why did Mormon include this?** To show us the character God rewards. Not brilliance. Not popularity. *Unwearyingness.* Nephi kept going even when nobody listened. He sought God's will, not his own life. And the trust God places in him is complete: "All things shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will."

That's not control. That's alignment. God and Nephi are so unified in purpose that Nephi's will has become God's will.

**Pattern for our day:** The spiritual power we seek doesn't come from asking harder. It comes from wanting what God wants — so completely that our asking and His answering become one motion.

---

### Helaman 11 — The Cycle That Won't Stop

*Nephi asks God to send famine instead of war, because "perhaps they will repent" ([Helaman 11:4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/11.md)). They do repent. The Gadianton band is swept away. Rain returns. Peace.*

Then — within the *same chapter* — the cycle restarts. By the 82nd year, "they did begin to forget the Lord their God" ([Helaman 11:36](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/11.md)). By the 85th year they are "ripening again for destruction" ([Helaman 11:37](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/11.md)). The Gadianton robbers reconstitute from "the secret plans of Gadianton" that were hidden in the earth.

"And in the space of not many years" — there's that phrase again — they grew to "an exceedingly great band of robbers" ([Helaman 11:26](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/11.md)).

**Why did Mormon include this?** To show us the cycle isn't a one-time historical event. It repeats. *Within a single chapter.* Repentance → peace → prosperity → forgetting → ripening for destruction. The speed is the warning. You can go from genuine repentance to "ripening for destruction" in less than a decade.

---

### Helaman 12 — Mormon Steps Out of the Narrative

*Mormon breaks the fourth wall. Speaking directly to the reader:*

> "And thus we can behold how false, and also the unsteadiness of the hearts of the children of men; yea, we can see that the Lord in his great infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who put their trust in him. Yea, and we may see at the very time when he doth prosper his people... yea, then is the time that they do harden their hearts, and do forget the Lord their God, and do trample under their feet the Holy One — yea, and this because of their ease, and their exceedingly great prosperity." ([Helaman 12:1–2](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/12.md))

And: "O how foolish, and how vain, and how evil, and devilish, and how quick to do iniquity, and how slow to do good... how quick to be lifted up in pride... and how slow to walk in wisdom's paths!" ([Helaman 12:4–5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/12.md))

**Why did Mormon include this?** Because he's not just recording history. He's *making his case.* This chapter is his thesis statement for the entire book of Helaman. He's seen the pattern across centuries: God blesses → people prosper → prosperity breeds pride → pride brings destruction → destruction brings repentance → repentance brings blessings → repeat.

And the most devastating detail: the dust of the earth is more obedient than man. "Behold, the dust of the earth moveth hither and thither, to the dividing asunder, at the command of our great and everlasting God" ([Helaman 12:8](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/12.md)). The mountains obey. The earth obeys. Men don't.

---

### Helaman 13 — Samuel's Warning: Happiness in Iniquity

*Samuel the Lamanite stands on the wall of Zarahemla. He is an outsider — a Lamanite — sent by God to warn the Nephites. His message is piercing:*

"Ye have sought for happiness in doing iniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of that righteousness which is in our great and Eternal Head" ([Helaman 13:38](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/13.md)).

And the prophet test: "if a man shall come among you and shall say: Do this, and there is no iniquity; do that and ye shall not suffer; yea, he will say: Walk after the pride of your own hearts... and if a man shall come among you and say this, ye will receive him, and say that he is a prophet. Yea, ye will lift him up, and ye will give unto him of your substance" ([Helaman 13:27–28](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/13.md)).

Versus: "if a prophet come among you and declareth unto you the word of the Lord, which testifieth of your sins and iniquities, ye are angry with him, and cast him out and seek all manner of ways to destroy him" ([Helaman 13:26](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/13.md)).

**Why did Mormon include this?** For the prophet test. Samuel gives us the diagnostic tool: which kind of messenger do you welcome? The one who says "all is well" and flatters — or the one who testifies of your sins? The people's response reveals which prophets they actually follow. The comfortable ones.

And the happiness doctrine: you cannot find happiness in iniquity. It is "contrary to the nature of that righteousness." Not just a rule. A law of nature. Like trying to plant corn and harvest wheat. The universe doesn't work that way.

---

### Helaman 14 — Signs and Agency

*Samuel prophesies the signs of Christ's birth (a night without darkness, a new star) and death (three days of darkness, earthquakes, tempests, graves opened). Then the doctrinal core:*

"He surely must die that salvation may come; yea, it behooveth him and becometh expedient that he dieth, to bring to pass the resurrection of the dead" ([Helaman 14:15](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/14.md)).

And the agency statement, right in the middle of the destruction prophecies: "Ye are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free" ([Helaman 14:30](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/14.md)).

**Why did Mormon include this?** Because agency is the hinge. Samuel describes the coming signs — massive, undeniable — and then immediately says: you're still free. Signs don't override agency. The signs are coming. What you do with them is up to you. And that's exactly what plays out in 3 Nephi 1–2: the signs come, and people *choose* to forget them.

---

### Helaman 15 — The Lamanite Commendation

*Samuel praises the Lamanites: "the more part of them are in the path of their duty, and they do walk circumspectly before God, and they do observe to keep his commandments and his statutes" ([Helaman 15:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/15.md)).*

They are "firm and steadfast in the faith" because they were "brought to the knowledge of the truth... and are led to believe the holy scriptures... which leadeth them to faith on the Lord, and unto repentance" ([Helaman 15:7–8](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/15.md)).

**Why did Mormon include this?** To complete the reversal. The Lamanites' path: scriptures → faith → repentance → steadfastness. The Nephites' path: prosperity → pride → hardness → destruction. Same God. Same gospel available. Different choices.

The Lamanite path is the antidote. It starts with the scriptures — the daily, unglamorous work of reading, believing, repenting. Not dramatic conversion experiences. Not signs. Scriptures and faith.

---

### Helaman 16 — The Rationalization Before the Storm

*Signs and wonders increase. Angels appear to "wise men." But the people rationalize:*

"Some things they may have guessed right, among so many; but behold, we know that all these great and marvelous works cannot come to pass" ([Helaman 16:16](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/16.md)).

"It is not reasonable that such a being as a Christ shall come" ([Helaman 16:18](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/16.md)).

They begin to "depend upon their own strength and upon their own wisdom" ([Helaman 16:15](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/16.md)).

And Satan's method: "he did go about spreading rumors and contentions upon all the face of the land, that he might harden the hearts of the people against that which was good and against that which should come" ([Helaman 16:22](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/16.md)).

**Why did Mormon include this?** Because this is the last chapter before the signs are fulfilled. Mormon is showing us how people talk *right before* everything changes. They depend on their own wisdom. They call prophecy "not reasonable." They rationalize away signs. And Satan's primary tool? *Rumors and contentions.* Not armies. Not overt evil. Rumors. Contentions. Noise.

**Pattern for our day:** Read those rationalizations again slowly. "It is not reasonable." "Some things they may have guessed right." "We cannot witness with our own eyes." These are modern arguments in ancient clothing.

---

## The Transition: Helaman Ends, 3 Nephi Begins

The book of Helaman ends with "the more part of the people remaining in their pride and wickedness" ([Helaman 16:10](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/16.md)). Signs are multiplying. Angels are appearing. And the people are hardening their hearts.

What follows in 3 Nephi is the fulfillment — but the cycle doesn't stop. It accelerates.

---

### 3 Nephi 1 — The Sign Comes, and So Does Satan

*The unbelievers set a day to execute the believers unless Samuel's sign of Christ's birth — a night without darkness — comes. Nephi cries to the Lord all day. The Lord's voice: "Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, the time is at hand, and on this night shall the sign be given, and on the morrow come I into the world" ([3 Nephi 1:13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1.md)).*

The sign comes. The wicked "fell to the earth and became as if they were dead, for they knew that the great plan of destruction which they had laid for those who believed... had been frustrated" ([3 Nephi 1:16](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1.md)).

But immediately: "from this time forth there began to be lyings sent forth among the people, by Satan, to harden their hearts, to the intent that they might not believe in those signs and wonders which they had seen" ([3 Nephi 1:22](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1.md)).

And the rising generation is "led away by some who were Zoramites, by their lyings and their flattering words" ([3 Nephi 1:29](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1.md)).

**Why did Mormon include this?** For the speed of Satan's counter-attack. The most dramatic sign in their history — a night without darkness — and *immediately* Satan sends "lyings." Not years later. Not a generation later. *From this time forth.* And the target? The rising generation. The young people who didn't have deep roots of faith.

**Pattern for our day:** Every spiritual experience, every testimony, every sign, every conference talk, every answered prayer — Satan will counter-attack. Immediately. With "lyings" — alternative explanations, distractions, seeds of doubt. And the most vulnerable are those without personal roots: the young, the new, the untested.

---

### 3 Nephi 2 — The Anatomy of Forgetting

> "The people began to forget those signs and wonders which they had heard, and began to be less and less astonished at a sign or a wonder from heaven, insomuch that they began to be hard in their hearts, and blind in their minds, and began to disbelieve all which they had heard and seen — imagining up some vain thing in their hearts, that it was wrought by men and by the power of the devil, to lead away and deceive the hearts of the people; and thus did Satan get possession of the hearts of the people again, insomuch that he did blind their eyes and lead them away to believe that the doctrine of Christ was a foolish and a vain thing." ([3 Nephi 2:1–2](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/2.md))

Nine years. Nine years after the night without darkness, and they've concluded "the doctrine of Christ was a foolish and a vain thing."

And: "the people did still remain in wickedness, notwithstanding the much preaching and prophesying which was sent among them" ([3 Nephi 2:10](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/2.md)).

**Why did Mormon include this?** For the mechanism. This is *how* people lose faith. Not through dramatic rejection. Through forgetting. Through becoming "less and less astonished." Through "imagining up some vain thing" — rationalizing away what they experienced. Each step is small. Each step feels reasonable. And the endpoint is calling the doctrine of Christ "a foolish and a vain thing."

**Pattern for our day:** This is the most relevant chapter in the entire sequence. How many of us have had powerful spiritual experiences and then slowly, gradually become "less and less astonished"? Not rejecting. Just... forgetting. Normalizing. Explaining away. This is the chapter to read when you feel your faith going numb.

---

### 3 Nephi 3 — Giddianhi's Letter: The Language of Evil

*Giddianhi, leader of the Gadianton robbers, writes a letter to Lachoneus demanding surrender. Mormon preserves the entire letter. It's a masterclass in manipulation:*

- Flattery: "great praise because of your firmness" (v. 2)
- Threats: "utter destruction" (v. 3)
- False victimhood: "the many wrongs which ye have done unto them" (v. 4)
- Invitation to join: "become our brethren and partners... acquainted with our secret works" (v. 7)
- Moral inversion: calling the Gadianton works "good" and "of ancient date" (v. 9)

*Lachoneus's response:*

"He was a just man, and could not be frightened by the demands and the threatenings of a robber" ([3 Nephi 3:12](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/3.md)).

He tells his people: "Except ye repent of all your iniquities, and cry unto the Lord, ye will in nowise be delivered" ([3 Nephi 3:15](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/3.md)).

And the Nephite tradition for chief captains: "some one that had the spirit of revelation and also prophecy" ([3 Nephi 3:19](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/3.md)).

**Why did Mormon include the full letter?** So we can recognize the *language* of secret combinations when we hear it. Flattery. False moral authority. Claims of ancient legitimacy. The accusation that the good people are actually the oppressors. This is the playbook. Mormon preserved it so we could identify it.

And Lachoneus's response is the model: don't be frightened by threats. Repent first. Trust prophetic and revelatory leadership. And crucially — don't attack first. Gidgiddoni says: "The Lord forbid; for if we should go up against them the Lord would deliver us into their hands" ([3 Nephi 3:21](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/3.md)). The righteous don't go looking for fights.

---

### 3 Nephi 4 — Victory Through Humility

*The Gadianton robbers attack. Despite their terrifying appearance ("dyed in blood... shorn heads"), the Nephites respond by falling to earth and crying to the Lord. The robbers thought this was fear.*

"But in this thing they were disappointed, for the Nephites did not fear them; but they did fear their God and did supplicate him for protection" ([3 Nephi 4:10](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/4.md)).

After victory: "they knew it was because of their repentance and their humility that they had been delivered from an everlasting destruction" ([3 Nephi 4:33](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/4.md)).

**Why did Mormon include this?** Because the Nephites win — and they know *why* they won. Not superior numbers. Not better strategy. "Their repentance and their humility." They said so explicitly. This is the positive proof of the pattern: when the people repent, God delivers. The variable is always the people's hearts, not the military calculus.

### 3 Nephi 5 — Mormon's Testimony

*The peak of righteousness: "there was not a living soul among all the people of the Nephites who did doubt in the least the words of all the holy prophets... therefore they did forsake all their sins, and their abominations... and did serve God with all diligence day and night" ([3 Nephi 5:1–3](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/5.md)).*

*Then Mormon introduces himself:*

"Behold, I am a disciple of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I have been called of him to declare his word among his people, that they might have everlasting life" ([3 Nephi 5:13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/5.md)).

**Why did Mormon include this?** This is the pivot. He pauses at the zenith — "not a living soul who did doubt" — to tell us *who he is* and *why he's writing.* He's a disciple. He's writing so people can have everlasting life. And the gathering of Israel (v. 24–26) is the ultimate purpose.

But this zenith is also the setup for what comes next. The highest point makes the coming fall hurt more.

### 3 Nephi 6 — The Fastest Fall

*"There was nothing in all the land to hinder the people from prospering continually, except they should fall into transgression" ([3 Nephi 6:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6.md)).*

The hinge sentence. Nothing could stop them — except themselves.

Within four years: "some were lifted up unto pride and boastings because of their exceedingly great riches... the people began to be distinguished by ranks, according to their riches and their chances for learning" ([3 Nephi 6:10–12](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6.md)).

The church breaks up. But: "a few of the Lamanites who were converted unto the true faith... they would not depart from it, for they were firm, and steadfast, and immovable" ([3 Nephi 6:14](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6.md)).

Satan's taxonomy: "tempting them to seek for power, and authority, and riches, and the vain things of the world" ([3 Nephi 6:15](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6.md)).

The verdict: "they did not sin ignorantly, for they knew the will of God concerning them, for it had been taught unto them; therefore they did wilfully rebel against God" ([3 Nephi 6:18](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6.md)).

Then the prophets come. And "many of those who testified of the things pertaining to Christ... were taken and put to death secretly by the judges" ([3 Nephi 6:23](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6.md)).

The murderers enter "that covenant which was given by them of old, which covenant was given and administered by the devil" ([3 Nephi 6:28](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6.md)).

**Why did Mormon include this?** Because this is the most compressed, clearest version of the pride cycle in all scripture. From "not a living soul who did doubt" (5:1) to "wilfully rebel against God" (6:18) in about four years. Four. Years.

And the details are devastating for us. "Distinguished by ranks, according to their riches and their chances for learning." Does that sound familiar? "Power, and authority, and riches, and the vain things of the world." The taxonomy of pride hasn't changed.

V. 18 removes every excuse: "they did not sin ignorantly." They knew. They chose.

### 3 Nephi 7 — Government Destroyed, Tribes Form

*The chief judge is murdered. The government collapses. People divide into tribes. Secret combinations install a king.*

"Six years had not passed away since the more part of the people had turned from their righteousness, like the dog to his vomit, or like the sow to her wallowing in the mire" ([3 Nephi 7:8](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/7.md)).

Yet even now: Nephi preaches with power. "Angels did minister unto him daily" ([3 Nephi 7:18](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/7.md)). He raises his brother from the dead. And: "there were but few who were converted unto the Lord" ([3 Nephi 7:21](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/7.md)).

**Why did Mormon include this?** Two patterns for our day:

First — the speed. Six years from total faith to societal collapse. That's not a generation. That's not "the rising generation fell away." That's the *same people* who were righteous in chapter 5.

Second — the Lord's response to darkness. When society is at its worst, the Lord sends His brightest servants. Daily angelic ministry. Power to raise the dead. The light intensifies precisely when the darkness deepens. But the choice remains: "few" are converted.

---

### 3 Nephi 8 — The Destruction

*"In the thirty and fourth year, in the first month, on the fourth day of the month, there arose a great storm, such an one as never had been known in all the land" ([3 Nephi 8:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/8.md)).*

Zarahemla burns. Moroni sinks into the sea. Moronihah is buried under a mountain. Highways broken up. Cities crushed. "The whole face of the land was changed" ([3 Nephi 8:12](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/8.md)). All "in about the space of three hours" ([3 Nephi 8:19](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/8.md)).

Then three days of darkness — "there could be no light, because of the darkness, neither candles, neither torches; neither could there be fire kindled" ([3 Nephi 8:21](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/8.md)).

The people's cry: "O that we had repented before this great and terrible day, and then would our brethren have been spared... O that we had repented before this great and terrible day, and had not killed and stoned the prophets, and cast them out" ([3 Nephi 8:24–25](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/8.md)).

**Why did Mormon include this?** Because the destruction is not random. It is specific. The highways of chapter 6:8 are broken (8:13). The cities named in chapters 6–7 are destroyed by name. The infrastructure of pride is dismantled. And the cry — "O that we had repented *before*" — is the final echo of every prophetic warning they received and rejected, from Samuel on the wall to Nephi on his tower to the angels who appeared daily.

The three hours of destruction mirror the three hours of darkness at the crucifixion in Jerusalem. This is not coincidence. Christ dies, and the world shakes. The physical manifestation of what sin does to the world — it breaks everything.

And the total darkness — no candles, no torches, no fire — is the physical equivalent of total spiritual darkness. When you have rejected every source of light, this is what remains.

### 3 Nephi 9 — Christ's Voice: City by City

*In the darkness, Christ speaks. He names each destroyed city and states the reason:*

- Zarahemla: burned ([3 Nephi 9:3](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.md))
- Moroni: sunk into the sea ([3 Nephi 9:4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.md))
- Moronihah: covered with earth ([3 Nephi 9:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.md))
- Jacobugath: burned "because of their secret murders and combinations; for it was they that did destroy the peace of my people and the government of the land" ([3 Nephi 9:9](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.md))

Jacobugath is singled out. Its wickedness was "above all the wickedness of the whole earth." Why? Not random evil. Specifically: secret combinations that destroyed peace and government. Christ Himself names this as the worst sin.

Then the pivot — from judgment to mercy:

"O all ye that are spared because ye were more righteous than they, will ye not now return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal you?" ([3 Nephi 9:13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.md))

"Mine arm of mercy is extended towards you, and whosoever will come, him will I receive" ([3 Nephi 9:14](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.md)).

And the new sacrifice: "Ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit" ([3 Nephi 9:20](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.md)).

**Why did Mormon include this?** Because Christ provides His own editorial commentary. He doesn't leave us guessing about why the destruction happened. Each city, each reason, named. And then — even after all this catastrophe — the arm of mercy is still extended. The invitation is still open. *Come unto me.* The sacrifice He requires is not burnt offerings. It's a broken heart.

---

### 3 Nephi 10 — The Survival Criterion

*Silence for many hours. Then Christ's voice again — the hen-and-chickens metaphor, repeated three times:*

- "How oft have I gathered you" — past ([3 Nephi 10:4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/10.md))
- "How oft would I have gathered you... and ye would not" — rejected ([3 Nephi 10:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/10.md))
- "How oft will I gather you... if ye will repent and return unto me" — future invitation ([3 Nephi 10:6](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/10.md))

Then Mormon gives us the filter:

"It was the more righteous part of the people who were saved, and it was they who received the prophets and stoned them not; and it was they who had not shed the blood of the saints, who were spared" ([3 Nephi 10:12](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/10.md)).

And Mormon addresses *us* directly: "And now, whoso readeth, let him understand; he that hath the scriptures, let him search them" ([3 Nephi 10:14](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/10.md)).

**Why did Mormon include this?** To give us the answer to the test. Who survives to meet Christ? The "more righteous" who "received the prophets." That's the criterion. Not perfection. Not dramatic heroism. Receiving the prophets — listening to them, not casting them out. The opposite of what Helaman 13:26–28 described.

And v. 14 — "whoso readeth, let him understand" — Mormon is looking across the centuries at *us.* He is saying: I wrote all of this for you. Do you understand? Search the scriptures. Make the connections. See the pattern.

### 3 Nephi 11 — Christ Appears

*A multitude gathered at the temple in Bountiful, "conversing about this Jesus Christ, of whom the sign had been given concerning his death" ([3 Nephi 11:2](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md)).*

A voice from heaven — "not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it being a small voice it did pierce them that did hear to the center, insomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their hearts to burn" ([3 Nephi 11:3](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md)).

Three times they hear the voice before they understand. Then: "Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name — hear ye him" ([3 Nephi 11:7](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md)).

Christ descends. Dressed in white. His first words:

"Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world. And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning." ([3 Nephi 11:10–11](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md))

Then the invitation: "Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world" ([3 Nephi 11:14](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md)).

"And it came to pass that the multitude went forth... going forth one by one until they had all gone forth, and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know of a surety" ([3 Nephi 11:15](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md)).

Then His first teaching:

"He that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another" ([3 Nephi 11:29](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md)).

And His doctrine:

"This is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the Father hath given unto me... the Father commandeth all men, everywhere, to repent and believe in me." ([3 Nephi 11:32](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md))

"Ye must repent, and become as a little child, and be baptized in my name, or ye can in nowise receive these things." ([3 Nephi 11:37](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md))

"Whoso buildeth upon this buildeth upon my rock, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against them. And whoso shall declare more or less than this, and establish it for my doctrine, the same cometh of evil." ([3 Nephi 11:39–40](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md))

**Why did Mormon include this?** Because this is what everything has been building toward. Every cycle of pride and fall. Every prophetic warning. Every destruction. All of it led here — to the temple in Bountiful, to the "more righteous part" who survived, to Christ descending in white.

And look at what He teaches first. Not cosmic theology. Not elaborate ritual. Two things:

1. **Stop contending.** After sixteen chapters of Helaman contention and ten chapters of 3 Nephi contention, Christ's first corrective is: contention is of the devil. Full stop.

2. **The doctrine is simple.** Repent. Believe. Be baptized. Become as a little child. That's it. "More or less than this... cometh of evil."

The "one by one" is crucial. Two thousand five hundred people at the temple, and they go forth *one by one* to feel His wounds. This is not a mass experience. It is two thousand five hundred *individual* encounters with the living Christ. Each person reaches their own hand into His side. Each person feels the nail prints. Each person knows for themselves.

## What Mormon Wants Us to See

Reading these 27 chapters with Benson's question — "Why did Mormon include this?" — reveals a deliberate editorial structure. Mormon isn't just recording history. He's building a case. He's laying out evidence. He's saying: *Here is the pattern. Here is what happens. Here is how it ends. And here is how it can end differently.*

### The Pride Cycle Repeats — Every Time Faster

| Cycle | From | To | Duration |
|-------|------|----|----------|
| Helaman 3–4 | Church prosperity | Half territory lost | "Not many years" |
| Helaman 6–7 | Some prosperity | Gadiantons in government | ~6 years |
| Helaman 11 | Famine-driven repentance | "Ripening for destruction" | ~9 years |
| 3 Nephi 5–7 | "Not a living soul who did doubt" | Government destroyed, tribalism | ~6 years |

The cycles get *faster.* The time from righteousness to wickedness compresses. Each go-around, the recovery is shorter and the fall is steeper. This is not a historical curiosity. This is the trajectory of a society that knows the truth and repeatedly chooses comfort over conversion.

### The Mechanism Is Always the Same

1. **Prosperity** → "ease" and "great riches"
2. **Pride** → "distinguished by ranks," "boastings," hearts set on riches
3. **Forgetting** → "less and less astonished," "imagining up some vain thing"
4. **Rejecting prophets** → anger at correction, embrace of flattery
5. **Secret combinations** → "expert in many words," promises of power
6. **Destruction** — or repentance, if it comes in time

### Two Paths, Side by Side

Mormon shows us both paths simultaneously:

**The Nephite path:** Prosperity → pride → hardness → Spirit withdraws → "boastings in their own strength" → destruction.

**The Lamanite path:** Scriptures → "easiness and willingness to believe" → faith → "firm and steadfast" → Spirit poured out.

Same God. Same gospel. Same era. Different choices.

### The Survival Criterion

When it all comes down — when the destruction hits, when the world shakes, when the darkness falls — who survives to meet Christ?

"It was the more righteous part of the people who were saved, and it was they who received the prophets and stoned them not" ([3 Nephi 10:12](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/10.md)).

Not the perfect. The "more righteous." The ones who *received the prophets.* That's the bar.

### What Christ Teaches When He Arrives

After sixteen chapters of complexity — secret combinations, political intrigue, military strategy, societal collapse — Christ arrives and teaches with devastating simplicity:

- Stop contending.
- Repent.
- Believe.
- Be baptized.
- Become as a little child.

"More or less than this... cometh of evil" ([3 Nephi 11:40](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md)).

The doctrine isn't complicated. We make it complicated. We add to it and subtract from it. We debate and dispute and contend. And Christ says: this is enough. Build on this rock. Everything else is sand.

---

## Patterns for Our Day

Reading Helaman through 3 Nephi 11 as a type for the last days — as Benson and Bednar both ask us to do — these patterns emerge:

### 1. Signs Don't Save

The most undeniable sign in Nephite history — a night without darkness — is forgotten within nine years ([3 Nephi 2:1](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/2.md)). Signs provide evidence but not conversion. Conversion requires something signs can't give: "easiness and willingness to believe" ([Helaman 6:36](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/6.md)).

### 2. The Speed Should Terrify Us

"In the space of not many years." "But a few years." "Six years." The time from peak righteousness to destruction is shorter than we think. The most dangerous moment is right after a spiritual high — the moment we start to coast.

### 3. Recognize the Language

Mormon preserved Giddianhi's letter ([3 Nephi 3:2–10](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/3.md)) so we could recognize the rhetoric of secret combinations: flattery, false victimhood, claims of ancient legitimacy, moral inversion. He also preserved the rationalization speech ([Helaman 16:15–22](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/16.md)): "it is not reasonable," "they may have guessed right among so many," "depend upon their own wisdom." And he preserved the prophet test ([Helaman 13:26–28](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/13.md)): which messenger do you welcome — the one who flatters, or the one who testifies of sin?

### 4. The Antidote Is Personal, Not Institutional

The church breaks up ([3 Nephi 6:14](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6.md)). The government falls ([3 Nephi 7:6](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/7.md)). Institutions fail. But the Lamanites who "were firm, and steadfast, and immovable" ([3 Nephi 6:14](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6.md)) didn't depend on institutions. They depended on the rock — "the rock of our Redeemer" ([Helaman 5:12](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.md)). Personal scripture study. Personal prayer. Personal faithfulness. That's what survives when everything else breaks.

### 5. The Foundation Was Always Available

Helaman 5:12 — the rock of our Redeemer — was taught before any of the destruction happened. The answer was given first. The Nephites knew it. They had it. And most of them didn't build on it. The foundation is available to us too. Right now. Before whatever comes. The question is whether we're building.

### 6. Christ Comes to the Temple

Of all the places Christ could have appeared, He came to the temple ([3 Nephi 11:1](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md)). The people who met Him were gathered there. They were conversing about Him. They were wondering. They were looking. And when the voice came — small, piercing, burning — they had to hear it three times before they understood. But they kept listening. They kept looking up. And He came.

### 7. One by One

"Going forth one by one until they had all gone forth" ([3 Nephi 11:15](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md)). This is the final pattern. When Christ comes, it is personal. Individual. One by one. Not group conversion. Not mass spectacle. One person at a time, reaching out, touching, knowing.

---

## Become

Having read these 27 chapters asking "Why did Mormon include this?", what do I do now?

1. **Build on the rock** — not theoretically, but daily. Helaman 5:12 isn't a memory verse. It's a construction project. Am I building today? Or coasting on yesterday's construction?

2. **Stay astonished** — 3 Nephi 2:1 warns about becoming "less and less astonished." I will not take my spiritual experiences for granted. I will write them down. I will remember them. I will not let them become normal.

3. **Take the prophet test** — honestly. When a prophet's words make me uncomfortable, is my instinct to receive or to rationalize? When someone flatters me with "all is well," do I recognize it? ([Helaman 13:26–28](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/13.md))

4. **Watch the speed** — If the Nephites can go from zero doubt (3 Nephi 5:1) to total rebellion (3 Nephi 6:18) in four years, I can drift faster than I think. Daily attention. Not weekly. Not conference-to-conference. Daily.

5. **Be at the temple** — When Christ comes, He comes to the temple. I will be there. Regularly. Watching. Listening. Conversing about Him. So that when the small voice comes, I'm in the place where I can hear it.

6. **Go forth one by one** — My encounter with Christ is mine. Not my parents'. Not my ward's. Not my generation's. One by one. I must thrust my own hands. I must know for myself.
