# The Atoning Love of Jesus Christ

**Elders Quorum Study | February 8, 2026**  
**Talk:** [The Atoning Love of Jesus Christ](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/10/35andersen.md)  
**Speaker:** Elder Neil L. Andersen (October 2025 General Conference)

---

## Overview

Elder Andersen speaks to two distinct audiences experiencing different kinds of spiritual pain:

1. **Those seeking forgiveness for their own serious sins** — "agonizing over what you have done and wondering if the Lord will ever forgive you"
2. **Those wounded by the sins of others** — carrying "heavy burdens caused by the sins or poor choices of others"

His message: **The Savior's Atonement covers both**. It's not just about forgiveness of sin—it's about healing, enabling, and strengthening.

---

## Key Teachings from the Talk

### Faith in Christ is the Key

Elder Andersen points to [Enos](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.md) as the pattern:

> Enos asked, **"Lord, how is it done?"**  
> The Lord replied: **"Because of thy faith in Christ"** ([Enos 1:7–8](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.md))

This is the heart of the matter. It's not our perfect repentance that saves us—it's our faith in Christ that unlocks His power to save.

### Four Elements of Coming to Christ

1. **Be honest with God** — He already knows; honesty opens the door to His help
2. **Be honest with yourself** — Stop minimizing or justifying
3. **Be honest with those you've harmed** — "restore as best you can what has been broken"
4. **Be honest with priesthood leaders** — Especially for serious sins (violation of the law of chastity, dishonesty, etc.)

### The Pattern: "Prosper by Degrees"

Elder Andersen references the story of Limhi's people in [Mosiah 21:14–16](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/21.md):

> "The Lord was **slow to hear their cry** because of their iniquities; nevertheless the Lord did hear their cries...  
> And it came to pass that the Lord did soften the hearts of the Lamanites...  
> And they began to **prosper by degrees** in the land."

**Insight:** Divine forgiveness and healing don't always come instantly. Sometimes the Lord's approval comes "by degrees"—gradually, as we demonstrate our faith and commitment. This is merciful, not punitive. It gives us time to:
- Rebuild broken relationships
- Develop new habits
- Prove to ourselves that we've changed
- Experience the joy of steady progress

### Restoring What Is Broken

One of the most powerful stories in the talk:

> A man who had divorced his wife after extended unfaithfulness realized his need to restore what was broken. Years after his divorce, he began **sending monthly payments to his former wife** as if the original divorce settlement had never existed—even though legally he owed her nothing.

**Key Question:** What might "restoring what is broken" look like in our own lives? This goes beyond saying "I'm sorry" to tangible acts of restitution.

## The Atonement Covers More Than Sin

### President Oaks' Teaching (October 2015)

Elder Andersen quotes from President Dallin H. Oaks' talk [Strengthened by the Atonement of Jesus Christ](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2015/10/strengthened-by-the-atonement-of-jesus-christ.md):

> "Our Savior's Atonement does more than assure us of immortality by a universal resurrection and give us the opportunity to be cleansed from sin by repentance and baptism. **His Atonement also provides the opportunity to call upon Him who has experienced all of our mortal infirmities** to give us the strength to bear the burdens of mortality. He knows of our anguish, and He is there for us."

The three purposes of the Atonement:
1. **Overcome death** (universal resurrection)
2. **Overcome sin** (for those who repent)
3. **Overcome mortal challenges** (for all who seek Him)

### Alma 7:11–12 — The Foundational Scripture

> "And he shall go forth, suffering **pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind**; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.
> 
> And he will take upon him **death**, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their **infirmities**, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, **that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people** according to their infirmities."

**"Succor"** = to run to aid, to give relief  

Christ didn't just suffer for sin. He suffered:
- Pains
- Afflictions
- Temptations
- Sicknesses
- Infirmities

**Why?** So He could know *according to the flesh* how to succor (run to help) His people. He knows what it feels like because He experienced it.

### What Does This Cover?

President Oaks lists specific challenges the Atonement strengthens us through:
- Serious illness or injury
- Death of a loved one
- Rejection of family or friends
- Disappointments in marriage
- Disabilities
- Depression and anxiety
- Addiction

> "His Atonement empowers Him to **succor us—to give us the strength to bear it all**."

## The Story of Elder Robert E. Wells

Elder Andersen shares a story about [Elder Robert E. Wells](../../gospel-library/eng/manual/teachings-of-living-prophets-student-manual-2016/3-general-authorities.md), a General Authority Seventy:

As an airline pilot years before his Church calling, Elder Wells was flying a commercial aircraft when one engine caught fire. In the emergency, the plane crashed, and some passengers died. Even though the investigation cleared Elder Wells of fault, he carried crushing guilt and sorrow.

> "For a full year, try as he might, **he could not let go of the emotional anguish** that accompanied him."

Then one day in a temple, Elder Wells felt the burden lift. After a year of prayer and faithfulness, peace finally came.

**Lessons:**
- Even when we are not at fault, we can carry heavy burdens
- Healing from trauma can take time
- The Lord's peace eventually comes to those who seek it faithfully

## Isaiah 61:3 — Beauty for Ashes

The talk references [Isaiah 61:3](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/isa/61.md), one of the most beautiful descriptions of Christ's healing ministry:

> "To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them **beauty for ashes**, the **oil of joy for mourning**, the **garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness**; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified."

This is the promise: Christ doesn't just remove our ashes—He replaces them with beauty. The mourning becomes joy. The heaviness becomes praise.

---

## For Those Wounded by Others

Elder Andersen directly addresses those carrying pain from others' sins:

- Victims of abuse
- Those betrayed by spouses
- Children of dysfunctional homes
- Anyone deeply hurt by another's choices

The Savior's Atonement applies here too:
> "He does so only for those who **seek Him and ask for His help**."

**Key Insight:** We don't need to have sinned to need the Atonement. Christ's suffering included our wounds, our trauma, our grief. We can bring these to Him.

---

## Moroni's Final Invitation

The talk concludes with [Moroni 10:32–33](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.md):

> "Yea, **come unto Christ, and be perfected in him**, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, **then is his grace sufficient for you**, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ...
> 
> And again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not his power, then are ye **sanctified in Christ by the grace of God**, through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy, without spot."

**Pattern:**
1. Come unto Christ
2. Deny yourself of ungodliness
3. Love God with all your might, mind, and strength
4. **His grace becomes sufficient** to perfect and sanctify you

We don't perfect ourselves. We come to Christ, and *His grace* perfects us.

## Discussion Questions for Elders Quorum

### Understanding the Atonement's Scope
1. Before reading this talk, how did you primarily think of the Atonement? (Forgiveness of sin? Resurrection? Something else?)
2. How does understanding that Christ suffered "pains, afflictions, temptations, sicknesses, and infirmities" change how you approach Him in prayer?

### For Those Seeking Forgiveness
3. Elder Andersen teaches that divine approval often comes "by degrees." Why might gradual healing be merciful rather than punitive?
4. What does it mean to "restore what is broken"? What might that look like in practice?

### For Those Wounded by Others
5. How can we apply the Atonement to wounds we didn't cause ourselves?
6. Elder Wells carried guilt for a year even though he wasn't at fault. Why do we sometimes carry burdens we don't deserve? How does Christ help with these?

### Personal Application
7. What "ashes" in your life would you like the Savior to exchange for "beauty"?
8. Enos asked, "Lord, how is it done?" The answer was "faith in Christ." What does active faith in Christ look like day-to-day?

### For Those We Minister To
9. How can this talk help us minister to someone struggling with:
   - Guilt from past sins?
   - Pain from others' choices?
   - Feeling unworthy of God's love?
