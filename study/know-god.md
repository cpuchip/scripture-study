# Knowing God

*"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."* — [John 17:3](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/john/17.md)

---

## Why This Matters

The Lectures on Faith teach that three things are necessary for any person to exercise faith in God unto life and salvation:

1. **The idea that He actually exists**
2. **A correct idea of His character, perfections, and attributes**
3. **An actual knowledge that the course of life we pursue is according to His will**

> "Without an acquaintance with these three important facts, the faith of every rational being must be imperfect and unproductive; but with this understanding, it can become perfect and fruitful, abounding in righteousness unto the praise and glory of God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ."
> — [Lecture Third, ¶5](../books/lecture-on-faith/03_lecture_3.md)

Eternal life IS knowing God ([John 17:3](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/john/17.md)). Not knowing *about* Him. Knowing *Him*. His character, His heart, His attributes—these aren't academic topics. They are the foundation of faith itself.

---

## Part 1: God the Father

### His Name

> "Behold, I am God; **Man of Holiness** is my name; **Man of Counsel** is my name; and **Endless** and **Eternal** is my name, also."
> — [Moses 7:35](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)

This is one of the most remarkable verses in all scripture. God names Himself. He is:
- **Man of Holiness** — a holy, exalted Man
- **Man of Counsel** — He counsels, guides, plans; the Grand Council was *His* council
- **Endless and Eternal** — these are His names, not just adjectives ([D&C 19:10-12](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.md))

His Son is therefore "Son of Man" — meaning Son of Man of Holiness. It's a title of divine parentage, not merely mortal humanity.

### His Body

> "The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us."
> — [D&C 130:22](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.md)

### His Character (Lecture Third)

The Lectures on Faith identify **six attributes of God's character** revealed in scripture:

| # | Character | Why It Matters for Faith |
|---|-----------|--------------------------|
| 1 | **He was God before the world and remains the same after** | No being greater can thwart His plans |
| 2 | **Merciful, gracious, slow to anger, abundant in goodness** | We who know our weakness can trust He won't cut us off |
| 3 | **He changes not** — same yesterday, today, forever | His mercy won't turn to cruelty; His love won't become hatred |
| 4 | **He is a God of truth and cannot lie** | We can trust His word absolutely |
| 5 | **He is no respecter of persons** | Every soul has equal access to His promises |
| 6 | **He is love** | Without this, all other attributes lack power over the heart |

> "If he did not, in the first instance, believe him to be God... he could not center his faith in him for life and salvation, for fear there should be a greater than he, who would thwart all his plans."
> — [Lecture Third, ¶19](../books/lecture-on-faith/03_lecture_3.md)

> "Without the idea that he is a God who changes not... doubt would take the place of faith. But with the idea that he changes not, faith lays hold upon the excellencies in his character with unshaken confidence."
> — [Lecture Third, ¶21](../books/lecture-on-faith/03_lecture_3.md)

### His Attributes (Lecture Fourth)

Beyond character, God possesses six **attributes**:

| # | Attribute | Scriptural Source |
|---|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Knowledge** — He knows all things, beginning to end | [Isaiah 46:9-10](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/isa/46.md) |
| 2 | **Faith/Power** — worlds framed by His word | [Hebrews 11:3](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/heb/11.md) |
| 3 | **Justice** — the habitation of His throne | [Psalm 89:14](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/ps/89.md) |
| 4 | **Judgment** — He delivers His saints from enemies | [Psalm 9:7](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/ps/9.md) |
| 5 | **Mercy** — He pours compassion on us in affliction | [Exodus 34:6](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/ex/34.md) |
| 6 | **Truth** — His word cannot fail | [Deuteronomy 32:4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/deut/32.md) |

> "Without the knowledge of all things, God would not be able to save any portion of his creatures; for it is by reason of the knowledge which he has of all things, from the beginning to the end, that enables him to give that understanding to his creatures, by which they are made partakers of eternal life."
> — [Lecture Fourth, ¶11](../books/lecture-on-faith/04_lecture_4.md)

### The Father Weeps

Perhaps the most intimate portrait of the Father in all scripture is [Moses 7:28-37](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md) — the Enoch narrative. God shows Enoch the wickedness of the world. Enoch sees the Father weep and is astonished:

> "How is it that thou canst weep, seeing thou art holy, and from all eternity to all eternity?"
> — [Moses 7:29](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)

Enoch can't reconcile an infinite, all-powerful God with tears. He lists God's qualifications:

> "Millions of earths like this, it would not be a beginning to the number of thy creations... naught but peace, justice, and truth is the habitation of thy throne; and mercy shall go before thy face and have no end; **how is it thou canst weep?**"
> — [Moses 7:30-31](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)

And God answers:

> "Behold these thy brethren; they are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in the day I created them; **and in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his agency;**
>
> And unto thy brethren have I said, and also given commandment, that **they should love one another, and that they should choose me, their Father**; but behold, they are without affection, and they hate their own blood."
> — [Moses 7:32-33](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)

**Why does God weep?** Because His children—whom He made with His own hands, whom He gave agency, whom He commanded to love each other and choose Him—**are without affection and hate their own blood**. They refused Him. Not out of ignorance, but out of hatred.

And then the devastating follow-up:

> "Among all the workmanship of mine hands there has not been so great wickedness as among thy brethren... **wherefore should not the heavens weep, seeing these shall suffer?**"
> — [Moses 7:36-37](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)

The heavens weep. Not just God—the entire heavenly host weeps for the suffering that sin brings upon God's children.

**What this reveals about the Father:** He is not a distant, detached architect. He is a parent whose heart breaks for His children. He gave them everything—knowledge, agency, commandments, love. And when they turn away, He weeps. Not anger first. Not judgment first. **Tears.**

And Enoch, upon beholding this, catches the same spirit:

> "Enoch knew, and looked upon their wickedness, and their misery, and wept and stretched forth his arms, and **his heart swelled wide as eternity**; and his bowels yearned; and all eternity shook."
> — [Moses 7:41](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)

### The Grand Council

> "According to that which was ordained in the midst of the **Council of the Eternal God** of all other gods before this world was, that should be reserved unto the finishing and the end thereof, when every man shall enter into his eternal presence and into his immortal rest."
> — [D&C 121:32](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.md)

The Father presided. He organized. He ordained. The plan was His. The purpose was His — to bring His children home. Every element of the plan was designed by a Being whose character is merciful, gracious, slow to anger, abundant in goodness, unchanging, truthful, impartial, and love.

## Part 2: Jesus Christ — The Son

### Who He Is

> "There are two personages who constitute the great, matchless, governing and supreme power over all things—by whom all things were created and made... They are the Father and the Son: The Father being a personage of spirit, glory and power: possessing all perfection and fulness: The Son, who was in the bosom of the Father, a personage of tabernacle, made, or fashioned like unto man."
> — [Lecture Fifth, ¶2](../books/lecture-on-faith/05_lecture_5.md)

### The Express Image of the Father

> "He is also the express image and likeness of the personage of the Father: possessing all the fulness of the Father, or, the same fulness with the Father."
> — [Lecture Fifth, ¶2](../books/lecture-on-faith/05_lecture_5.md)

To know Christ is to know the Father. [John 14:9](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/john/14.md): "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father."

### Grace to Grace

> "And I, John, saw that he received not of the fulness at the first, but received grace for grace; And he received not of the fulness at first, but continued from **grace to grace**, until he received a fulness."
> — [D&C 93:12-13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)

Even Christ grew. He went "from grace to grace." And we are promised the same path:

> "For if you keep my commandments you shall receive of his fulness, and be glorified in me as I am in the Father; therefore, I say unto you, you shall receive **grace for grace**."
> — [D&C 93:20](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)

### He Descended Below All Things

> "He is also the express image and likeness of the personage of the Father... and descended in suffering below that which man can suffer, or, in other words, suffered greater sufferings, and was exposed to more powerful contradictions than any man can be. **But notwithstanding all this, he kept the law of God, and remained without sin**: Showing thereby that **it is in the power of man to keep the law and remain also without sin.**"
> — [Lecture Fifth, ¶2](../books/lecture-on-faith/05_lecture_5.md)

This is a stunning statement. Christ's sinless life in the face of maximum suffering demonstrates that it IS possible for man to keep the law. He didn't just save us—He showed us it could be done.

### His Intercessory Prayer — What Christ Wants for Us

[John 17](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/john/17.md) is Christ's most intimate prayer. He reveals what He wants for us:

> "That they all may be **one**; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be **one in us**."
> — [John 17:21](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/john/17.md)

> "I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made **perfect in one**; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and **hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.**"
> — [John 17:23](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/john/17.md)

The Father loves us as He loves Christ. Christ's prayer is that we become one with Them—not absorbed, but unified in mind, glory, and love.

### How We Can Know Him

> "Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, **shall see my face and know that I am.**"
> — [D&C 93:1](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)

This is a promise—not just for prophets but for "every soul." The conditions:
1. Forsake sins
2. Come unto Him
3. Call on His name
4. Obey His voice
5. Keep His commandments

---

## Part 3: The Holy Ghost — He Who Testifies of Truth

### A Distinct Personage

> "The Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us."
> — [D&C 130:22](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.md)

The Holy Ghost is a distinct member of the Godhead—a personage of spirit, separate from lightof Christ.

### The Mind of the Father and Son

The Lecture on Faith offers a remarkable description:

> "The Father and the Son possessing the **same mind**, the same wisdom, glory, power and fulness... the Son being filled with the fulness of the Mind, glory and power, or, in other words, **the Spirit, glory and power of the Father**... which Spirit is shed forth upon all who believe on his name and keep his commandments."
> — [Lecture Fifth, ¶2](../books/lecture-on-faith/05_lecture_5.md)

The Holy Ghost is described as the shared *mind* of the Father and Son—the Spirit of truth that proceeds from the Father ([John 15:26](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/john/15.md)). When we receive the Holy Ghost, we receive the very same mind that unites Father and Son.

### What He Does

1. **Testifies of truth** — "By the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things" ([Moroni 10:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.md))
2. **Testifies of the Father and Son** — "The Holy Ghost... beareth record of the Father and the Son" ([Moses 7:11](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md))
3. **Brings all things to remembrance** — [John 14:26](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/john/14.md)
4. **Constant companion** — "The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion" ([D&C 121:46](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.md))
5. **Sanctifies** — "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth" ([John 17:17](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/john/17.md))

### Distinct from the Light of Christ

The **Light of Christ** is given to every person born into the world:

> "I am the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world."
> — [D&C 93:2](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)

This is conscience, moral intuition, the sense of right and wrong that all humans feel. It's universal—not based on covenant or baptism.

The **Holy Ghost**, by contrast:
- Is a personage of spirit
- Is received by the laying on of hands after baptism
- Can be a *constant companion* (not just occasional influence)
- Reveals specific truths, not just general moral sense
- Brings the *mind* of God—His actual thoughts and feelings—into our hearts

The Light of Christ draws us toward Him. The Holy Ghost brings us *into* His presence—spiritually, experientially, eventually literally.

---

## Part 4: The Godhead United — One in Purpose

### Three Becoming One

> "These three constitute the Godhead, and are one: The Father and the Son possessing the same mind, the same wisdom, glory, power and fulness."
> — [Lecture Fifth, ¶2](../books/lecture-on-faith/05_lecture_5.md)

They are one—not in substance (as the creeds say) but in **mind, purpose, glory, and love**.

### And We Are Invited Into That Unity

> "As the Son partakes of the fulness of the Father through the Spirit, so the saints are, **by the same Spirit, to be partakers of the same fulness**, to enjoy the same glory; for as the Father and the Son are one, **so in like manner the saints are to be one in them**, through the love of the Father, the mediation of Jesus Christ, and the gift of the Holy Spirit; they are to be heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ."
> — [Lecture Fifth, ¶3](../books/lecture-on-faith/05_lecture_5.md)

This is the promise: through the Holy Ghost, we receive the same mind, the same glory, the same oneness that exists between Father and Son. We become "heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ" ([Romans 8:17](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/rom/8.md)).

---

## Part 5: How God Leads — D&C 121

The character of God is reflected in how He expects priesthood (and all authority) to be exercised:

> "No power or influence can or ought to be maintained... only by **persuasion**, by **long-suffering**, by **gentleness** and **meekness**, and by **love unfeigned**; By **kindness**, and **pure knowledge**, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without **hypocrisy**, and without **guile**."
> — [D&C 121:41-42](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.md)

This is not just instruction for priesthood holders. This is the *character of God Himself* reflected in how He leads His children. Persuasion, not force. Long-suffering, not impatience. Kindness, not harshness. Pure knowledge, not manipulation.

And the promise for those who embody this character:

> "Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; **then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God**; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven."
> — [D&C 121:45](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.md)

> "**The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion**, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever."
> — [D&C 121:46](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.md)

---

## Summary: Who Is God?

### The Father

## Questions for Further Study

1. If God's character is the foundation of faith, which of the six character traits (Lecture Third) do I understand the *least*? Which do I trust the most?

2. The Father weeps. How does that change my understanding of His relationship to me?

3. Christ went "from grace to grace." What does my current "grace to grace" journey look like? Where am I progressing? Where am I stuck?

4. The Holy Ghost shares the **mind** of Father and Son with us. When have I experienced that? What did it feel like?

5. D&C 121:41-42 describes God's character in action. How well does my leadership, parenting, and teaching reflect these attributes?
