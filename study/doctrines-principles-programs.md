# Doctrines, Principles, and Programs

*A study on the hierarchy of eternal truths, their applications, and the policies that implement them.*

---

## The Question

What is the difference between:
- **Doctrine** — eternal truths revealed by God
- **Principle** — applications or expressions of doctrine
- **Policy/Program** — changeable procedures implementing principles

Understanding this hierarchy helps us know what is unchanging vs. what can adapt to circumstances. It also helps us respond to changes in Church practice without confusion.

## Definitions

### Doctrine: Eternal Truth

> "Doctrine is eternal truth—found in the scriptures and the words of latter-day prophets—that shows us the way to become like our Father in Heaven and return to Him."
> — [Teaching in the Savior's Way](../gospel-library/eng/manual/teaching-in-the-saviors-way-2022/07-part-2/10-teach-the-doctrine.md)

**Characteristics of Doctrine:**
- Revealed by God through prophets
- Unchanging and eternal
- Found in scriptures and words of prophets
- Confirmed through councils of the Church
- Centers on Jesus Christ and the plan of salvation

> "The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it."
> — Joseph Smith, [Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/tg/jesus-christ-atonement-through.md), p. 121

**Examples of Doctrine:**
- God is our Heavenly Father ([Moses 1:4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.md))
- Jesus Christ is the Son of God and our Redeemer ([3 Nephi 11:10-11](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md))
- The Atonement of Jesus Christ makes repentance and resurrection possible ([Alma 34:8-9](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.md))
- The family is ordained of God ([The Family: A Proclamation to the World](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world.md))
- We are spirit children of Heavenly Parents ([Romans 8:16-17](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/rom/8.md))
- Resurrection is universal ([1 Corinthians 15:22](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.md))

### Principle: Applied Truth

Principles are applications of doctrine—guidelines that help us live doctrinal truths. They derive from doctrine and guide behavior but may have varying implementations.

> "True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior. The study of the doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior."
> — President Boyd K. Packer, "Little Children," October 1986 General Conference

**Characteristics of Principles:**
- Derived from doctrine
- Generally stable, but application may vary
- Guide how we live gospel truths
- Bridge between eternal truth and daily practice

**Examples of Principles:**
- **Doctrine:** We are stewards of what God gives us  
  **Principle:** Tithing—giving one-tenth to the Lord
- **Doctrine:** The Sabbath is holy  
  **Principle:** Keep the Sabbath day holy through worship and rest
- **Doctrine:** Our bodies are temples  
  **Principle:** Word of Wisdom—care for our bodies
- **Doctrine:** The family is central to God's plan  
  **Principle:** Family home evening, family prayer, scripture study together

### Policy/Program: Changeable Implementation

Policies and programs are the procedures and structures the Church uses to implement principles. They can and do change based on circumstances, revelation, and needs.

**Characteristics of Policies/Programs:**
- Implement principles in practical ways
- Subject to change as circumstances require
- Adapted to different cultures, times, and places
- Established by Church leaders for order and effectiveness

**Examples of Policies/Programs:**
- **Principle:** Sabbath worship  
  **Policy:** Meeting schedule (2-hour block vs. former 3-hour block)
- **Principle:** Missionary service  
  **Policy:** Age requirements (changed from 19/21 to 18/19 in 2012)
- **Principle:** Temple worship  
  **Policy:** Temple recommend interview questions, garment guidelines
- **Principle:** Scripture study  
  **Program:** Come, Follow Me curriculum
- **Principle:** Youth development  
  **Program:** Children and Youth program (replaced Scouting in many areas)

## The Hierarchy in Scripture

### The Doctrine of Christ

The clearest statement of pure doctrine comes from the Savior Himself:

> "And this is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the Father hath given unto me; and I bear record of the Father, and the Father beareth record of me, and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me; and I bear record that the Father commandeth all men, everywhere, to repent and believe in me.
>
> And whoso believeth in me, and is baptized, the same shall be saved; and they are they who shall inherit the kingdom of God.
>
> And whoso believeth not in me, and is not baptized, shall be damned. ...
>
> And whoso shall declare more or less than this, and establish it for my doctrine, the same cometh of evil."
> — [3 Nephi 11:32-35, 40](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.md)

The doctrine of Christ is simple:
1. **Faith** in Jesus Christ
2. **Repentance**
3. **Baptism** by immersion for remission of sins
4. **Gift of the Holy Ghost** by laying on of hands
5. **Endure to the end**

This is the unchanging core. Everything else supports, applies, or implements these truths.

### Pattern from the New Testament

The Jerusalem Council in Acts 15 shows how the early Church distinguished between doctrine and practice:

**Doctrinal Question:** Must Gentile converts be circumcised and keep the law of Moses to be saved?

**Council Decision:** No—salvation comes through grace, not the law of Moses. But they gave practical guidelines (avoid idolatry, fornication, blood) to help Gentile converts live in harmony with Jewish members.

> "For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things."
> — [Acts 15:28](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/acts/15.md)

The doctrine (salvation through Christ) was affirmed. The policy (circumcision required) was changed.

## How Doctrine is Established

From Elder D. Todd Christofferson's ["The Doctrine of Christ"](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2012/04/the-doctrine-of-christ.md) (April 2012):

> "How do we know what is true doctrine? ... The doctrine is taught by all 15 members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve. It is not hidden in an obscure paragraph of one talk. ... If one person speaks on a topic or it comes through a single source, you might consider it and it might be good, but the test is whether something has been taught repeatedly and by the most senior Brethren."

**Tests for True Doctrine:**
1. Founded on the scriptures
2. Taught by multiple prophets and apostles
3. Consistent across time
4. Confirmed by the Holy Ghost
5. Helps us build faith in Jesus Christ

**What is NOT necessarily doctrine:**
- Every statement by a Church leader
- Personal opinions of leaders
- Speculation about unclear matters
- Cultural traditions

> "A prophet is a prophet only when he is acting as such."
> — Joseph Smith

## Why This Matters

### 1. Grounds Our Faith in the Unchanging

When policies change (meeting schedules, missionary ages, temple procedures), our faith need not be shaken. Doctrine remains constant. The Atonement is the same. The plan of salvation is the same. God's love is the same.

### 2. Helps Us Respond to Change

**Healthy response to policy change:**
> "The doctrine hasn't changed, but the Church has found a better way to implement it."

**Unhealthy response:**
> "Everything I believed is wrong!" (Mistaking policy for doctrine)

### 3. Focuses Our Teaching

From Teaching in the Savior's Way:

> "Carefully consider the doctrine and principles you decide to focus on. While there are many truths in the scriptures that can be discussed, it is best to focus on truths of the gospel that lead to conversion and build faith in Jesus Christ."

Teach doctrine → principles → practical application. Not the reverse.

### 4. Enables Local Adaptation

The Church operates in 170+ countries. Policies must adapt to local laws, cultures, and circumstances. But doctrine is the same in every nation.

## Questions for Further Study

1. When a Church practice changes, how do I determine if it's a doctrinal shift or a policy adjustment?

2. How do principles help me apply unchanging doctrine to my specific circumstances?

3. Why might the Lord allow policies to change while keeping doctrine constant?

4. How does understanding this hierarchy help me teach the gospel more effectively?

5. What doctrines have I mistakenly treated as policies (or vice versa)?

---

## Personal Application

Understanding this framework helps me:

- **Not be shaken** when the Church adjusts programs or policies
- **Focus my teaching** on eternal truths rather than procedural details
- **Exercise faith** in continuing revelation while grounded in unchanging doctrine
- **Share the gospel** by emphasizing what truly saves (the doctrine of Christ) rather than what merely organizes (programs)
- **Distinguish** between "the Lord said" (doctrine) and "the Church currently does" (policy)

> "The simple, basic truths the Savior taught and exemplified have the greatest power to change our lives—truths about His Atonement, the plan of salvation, the commandments to love God and love our neighbor, and so on."
