## The Central Question

D&C 84:33 says:

> "For whoso is faithful unto the **obtaining these two priesthoods** of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies."

What exactly does "obtaining" mean here?

- Is it simply **ordination** to the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods?
- Or does it include **receiving the ordinances** that flow from those priesthoods?
- And if the latter, how do **women** participate in "obtaining" priesthood blessings?

## Webster's 1828 Definitions

Understanding Joseph Smith's vocabulary provides crucial insight.

### OBTAIN
> "To **get hold of by effort**; to gain possession of; to procure; to acquire, in any way... **Obtain implies desire for possession, and some effort** directed to the attainment of that which is not immediately within our reach."

**Key distinction**: "We **obtain** what comes in any way, provided we desire it... we **acquire** what comes to us gradually in the regular exercise of our abilities."

### RECEIVE
> "To **take, as something that is offered**, given, committed, sent... to accept."

**Key distinction**: "To **receive** describes simply the act of taking. To **accept** denotes the taking with approval, or for the purposes for which a thing is offered."

### The Pattern
- **OBTAIN** = Active seeking with effort and desire
- **RECEIVE** = Accepting what is offered

"Faithful unto the **obtaining**" suggests active, faithful **pursuit**, not passive waiting.

## General Conference Teachings

### Elder Carlos E. Asay (1985)
[The Oath and Covenant of the Priesthood](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/1985/10/the-oath-and-covenant-of-the-priesthood.md)

Elder Asay broke down "man's covenant" into four elements:

> **1. Receive the Melchizedek Priesthood in Good Faith**
> "When a man has the Melchizedek Priesthood conferred upon him, he is expected to *receive* it in good faith... As people are confirmed members of the Church, those in authority lay hands upon their heads and command, 'Receive the Holy Ghost.' Does not the same apply to the conferral of priesthood power?"

> **2. Magnify Callings**
> "The transcendent blessings of the priesthood **do not come by ordination alone**. We are instructed: 'Ordination to the priesthood is a **prerequisite** to receiving [blessings], but it does **not guarantee** them. For a man actually to obtain them, he must **faithfully discharge the obligation** which is placed upon him when he receives the priesthood.'"

> **3. Obey the Commandments**
> "To give diligent heed to the words of eternal life."

> **4. Live by Every Word of God**
> "Words of eternal life come from one source: God. They are made available to us through the fountain of the holy scriptures and the fountain of living prophets."

**Insight**: Ordination is a *prerequisite*, not a *guarantee*. You must faithfully "obtain" the blessings by keeping covenants.

### President Henry B. Eyring (2008)
[Faith and the Oath and Covenant of the Priesthood](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2008/04/faith-and-the-oath-and-covenant-of-the-priesthood.md)

President Eyring taught that faithful service qualifies us:

> "Rising to the possibilities of the oath and covenant brings the greatest of all the gifts of God: **eternal life**. That is a purpose of the Melchizedek Priesthood. Through **keeping the covenants** as we receive the priesthood and **renewing them in the temple ceremonies**, we are promised by an **oath** made by our Heavenly Father, Elohim, that we will gain the **fulness of His glory** and live as He lives."

He also emphasized:

> "Whether you accept the oath and covenant and find it too difficult or if you fail to try, the penalty is the same. There is no question, therefore, that **your best course and mine is to receive the holy priesthood and try with all of our hearts to keep its covenants**."

**Insight**: The oath and covenant is connected to both ordination **and** temple ceremonies.

### President Russell M. Nelson (2011)
[Covenants](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2011/10/covenants.md)

President Nelson (then an Apostle) made a remarkable statement:

> "Brethren of the covenant have the right to qualify for the oath and covenant of the priesthood. If you are 'faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods … and the magnifying [of your] calling, [you] are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of [your] bodies.' That is not all. Men who worthily receive the priesthood receive the Lord Jesus Christ, and those who receive the Lord receive God the Father. And those who receive the Father receive all that He has. **Incredible blessings flow from this oath and covenant to worthy men, women, and children in all the world.**"

**Insight**: The blessings of the oath and covenant flow to **men, women, and children**—not just ordained priesthood holders.

### Elder Quentin L. Cook (2019)
[Great Love for Our Father's Children](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2019/04/43cook.md)

Elder Cook made an explicit connection between temple sealing and priesthood:

> "When a man and woman are sealed in the temple, they enter **the holy order of matrimony in the new and everlasting covenant, an order of the priesthood**. Together they **obtain and receive priesthood blessings and power** to direct the affairs of their family. Women and men have unique roles as outlined in 'The Family: A Proclamation to the World,' **but their stewardships are equal in value and importance**. They have **equal power to receive revelation** for their family."

**Insight**: Both husband and wife "**obtain and receive** priesthood blessings and power" through temple sealing.

### Sister Julie B. Beck (2006)
[An Outpouring of Blessings](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2006/04/an-outpouring-of-blessings.md)

Sister Beck (then in the Young Women's General Presidency) taught:

> "I hope our granddaughters and grandsons grow up knowing that they are not and have never been **third-party observers** of the priesthood. The blessings of the priesthood, which '**are available to men and women alike**,' are woven in and through and around their lives."

> "We teach all young men and young women to prepare to go to the temple so they can '**receive the blessings of [the] fathers that [they] may be entitled to the highest blessings of the priesthood.**'"

Quoting President Ezra Taft Benson:

> "When our children obey the Lord and go to the temple to receive their blessings and enter into the marriage covenant, they enter into **the same order of the priesthood** that God instituted in the very beginning with father Adam."

And the powerful equalizing principle:

> "**Priesthood blessings are the great equalizer.** Those blessings are the same for men and women, for boys and girls; they are the same for married and single, rich and poor, for the intellectual and the illiterate, for the well-known and the obscure."

**Insight**: The "highest blessings of the priesthood" come through temple ordinances, available to all worthy members.

### Elder Anthony D. Perkins (2012)
[Beware Concerning Yourselves](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2012/10/beware-concerning-yourselves.md)

Elder Perkins described the covenant as a **journey**:

> "Each of you has entered, or will soon enter, into the oath and covenant of the Melchizedek Priesthood. In that covenant is embedded a **glorious journey** that **begins with receiving both the lesser and higher priesthoods**, **progresses through magnifying our callings**, and **climbs ever upward** to God's grandest vistas, until we **receive 'all that [the] Father hath.'**"

**Insight**: The oath and covenant is a progressive journey—receiving, magnifying, and ultimately receiving all the Father has.

## Synthesis: What Does "Obtaining" Mean?

Based on these prophetic teachings, "obtaining these two priesthoods" appears to have layers:

### For Men Specifically
1. **Ordination to the Aaronic Priesthood** — Receiving authority to baptize, administer sacrament
2. **Ordination to the Melchizedek Priesthood** — Receiving authority to confirm, bless, ordain

### For All Members
3. **Receiving ordinances administered by the priesthood**:
   - Baptism (Aaronic priesthood)
   - Gift of the Holy Ghost (Melchizedek priesthood)
   - Temple endowment (Melchizedek priesthood)
   - Temple sealing (Melchizedek priesthood)

### The "Highest Blessings"
The temple is where the "highest blessings of the priesthood" are available to **all** worthy members. Through sealing, both husband and wife enter "the same order of the priesthood."

## Questions for Further Reflection

1. If "obtaining" requires effort and desire (per Webster), what does that look like practically? How do I show God I'm actively seeking?

2. Elder Asay said ordination is a "prerequisite" but not a "guarantee." What turns a prerequisite into the actual blessing?

3. President Eyring connected the oath and covenant to "renewing them in the temple ceremonies." How does regular temple attendance relate to "obtaining" the priesthood?

4. If priesthood blessings are "the great equalizer," how should I think about the relationship between ordination and the ordinances I've received?

5. Elder Cook says sealed couples "obtain and receive priesthood blessings and power." How does my marriage change my understanding of the priesthood?

## The Receiving Chain

D&C 84:35-38 shows a receiving chain:

| You Receive... | And Through That, Receive... |
|----------------|------------------------------|
| The priesthood | The Lord's servants |
| The Lord's servants | The Lord Jesus Christ |
| The Lord | The Father |
| The Father | His kingdom |
| His kingdom | **All that the Father hath** |

This chain suggests that **receiving** the priesthood (whether through ordination or ordinances) puts you in position to receive increasingly greater blessings—culminating in exaltation.

---

## Application

This study suggests several applications:

### Personal Worthiness
Actively "obtain" by living worthy of each ordinance and covenant. Don't take ordinances for granted.

### Temple Attendance
The temple is where we renew covenants and receive the highest blessings. Regular attendance = ongoing "obtaining."

### Magnifying Callings
Ordination is prerequisite, not destination. Magnify every calling, every responsibility, every opportunity to serve.

### Family Focus
For married members, recognize that temple sealing places both spouses in "an order of the priesthood" with equal power to receive revelation and blessings for the family.

### Gratitude
The blessings of the priesthood are available to **all**—children, youth, men, women, married, single. This is profound equality before God.
