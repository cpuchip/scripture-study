## Part 1: Definitions from Scripture and Webster 1828

### Truth

**Scriptural Definition (D&C 93:24):**
> "And truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come"
> — [D&C 93:24](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)

**Properties of Truth:**
- **Independent** — "All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to act for itself" ([D&C 93:30](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md))
- **Uncreatable** — Intelligence, "the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be" ([D&C 93:29](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md))
- **Abiding** — "truth abideth and hath no end" ([D&C 88:66](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md))
- **Self-acting** — truth acts "for itself... otherwise there is no existence" ([D&C 93:30](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md))
- **Forsakes evil** — "Light and truth forsake that evil one" ([D&C 93:37](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md))

**Webster 1828:** "Conformity to fact or reality; exact accordance with that which is, or has been, or shall be." Also: "Righteousness; true religion."

**Key Insight:** Notice the near-perfect alignment. Webster says truth is "exact accordance with that which *is*, or *has been*, or *shall be*." D&C 93:24 says truth is "knowledge of things as they *are*, and as they *were*, and as they *are to come*." These were written in the same era. The scriptural definition adds something: truth isn't merely the state of reality — it's the *knowledge* of that state. Truth is **reality comprehended.**

### Light

**Scriptural Definition (D&C 88:6-13):**
> "He that ascended up on high, as also he descended below all things, in that he comprehended all things, that he might be in all and through all things, **the light of truth**; Which truth shineth. **This is the light of Christ.**"
> — [D&C 88:6-7](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md)

> "Which light proceedeth forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space — The light which is **in all things**, which **giveth life to all things**, which is **the law by which all things are governed**, even the power of God"
> — [D&C 88:12-13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md)

**Properties of Light:**
- **Is the Light of Christ** — identified as a specific thing, not a metaphor ([D&C 88:7](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md))
- **Fills the immensity of space** — omnipresent ([D&C 88:12](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md))
- **In all things** — not merely illuminating them, but *within* them ([D&C 88:13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md))
- **Giveth life** — the animating force of all existence ([D&C 88:13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md))
- **Is the law** — the governing principle of all things ([D&C 88:13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md))
- **Quickens understanding** — enables comprehension and consciousness ([D&C 88:11](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md))
- **Shineth** — it radiates; it's active, not static ([D&C 88:7](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md))
- **Cleaveth unto light** — "light cleaveth unto light" ([D&C 88:40](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md))

**Webster 1828:** "That agent, force, or action in nature by the operation of which upon the organs of sight, objects are rendered visible or luminous." Also: "Mental or spiritual illumination; enlightenment; knowledge; information." And, strikingly: "**Life; existence.**"

**Key Insight:** Webster's 6th definition of light is "Life; existence." That's exactly what D&C 88:13 says — light "giveth life to all things." The 1828 language already associates light with life, and scripture makes it explicit: light IS the animating force. It's not a metaphor for understanding — it IS understanding, AND life, AND law, simultaneously.

### Spirit

**Scriptural Definition (D&C 131:7-8):**
> "There is no such thing as immaterial matter. All spirit is matter, but it is more fine or pure, and can only be discerned by purer eyes; We cannot see it; but when our bodies are purified we shall see that it is all matter."
> — [D&C 131:7-8](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131.md)

**Also (D&C 93:33):**
> "For man is spirit. The elements are eternal, and spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy"
> — [D&C 93:33](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)

**Also (D&C 88:15):**
> "And the spirit and the body are the soul of man."
> — [D&C 88:15](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md)

**Properties of Spirit:**
- **Is matter** — literally, physically, not metaphorically ([D&C 131:7](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131.md))
- **More fine or pure** — a different grade of matter, not a different category ([D&C 131:7](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131.md))
- **Requires purer eyes to discern** — the observer must match the refinement of the thing observed ([D&C 131:7](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131.md))
- **Inseparable connection with element produces fulness** — spirit alone is incomplete ([D&C 93:33-34](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md))
- **Eternal** — "the elements are eternal" ([D&C 93:33](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md))

**Webster 1828:** "Life, or living substance, considered independently of corporeal existence; an intelligence conceived of apart from any physical organization or embodiment; vital essence, force, or energy, as distinct from matter." Also: "The intelligent, immaterial and immortal part of man."

**Key Insight:** Here's where the Restoration *directly overturns* 1828 convention. Webster says spirit is "distinct from matter" and "immaterial." Joseph Smith says "there is no such thing as immaterial matter." Webster reflects the Platonic/Christian dualism of his era: spirit = non-physical. The Restoration collapses that dualism. Spirit IS matter — just purer. This has massive implications.

### Element

**Scriptural Definition (D&C 93:33, 35):**
> "The elements are eternal"
> "The elements are the tabernacle of God; yea, man is the tabernacle of God, even temples"
> — [D&C 93:33, 35](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)

**Properties of Element:**
- **Eternal** — never created, never destroyed ([D&C 93:33](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md))
- **Tabernacle of God** — housing for divine presence ([D&C 93:35](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md))
- **Necessary for fulness** — spirit + element = fulness of joy ([D&C 93:33](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md))
- **Governed by law** — moves "in their times and their seasons" ([D&C 88:42](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md))
- **Obeys** — "the Gods watched those things which they had ordered until they obeyed" ([Abraham 4:18](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/4.md))

**Webster 1828:** "One of the simplest or essential parts or principles of which anything consists." Also: "The whole material composing the world."

### Intelligence

**Scriptural Definition (D&C 93:29, 36):**
> "Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be"
> "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth"
> — [D&C 93:29, 36](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)

**Properties of Intelligence:**
- **Uncreated** — existed before God organized it ([D&C 93:29](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md))
- **Self-acting** — "to act for itself, as all intelligence also; otherwise there is no existence" ([D&C 93:30](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md))
- **Equated with light AND truth** — intelligence = light of truth = light and truth ([D&C 93:29, 36](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md))
- **Varies in degree** — "one being more intelligent than the other" ([Abraham 3:19](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.md))
- **Cleaveth unto intelligence** — like attracts like ([D&C 88:40](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md))
- **Necessary for existence** — "otherwise there is no existence" ([D&C 93:30](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md))

**Webster 1828:** "The act or state of knowing; the exercise of the understanding." Also: "An intelligent being or spirit."

**Key Insight:** Webster's 6th definition is "An intelligent being or spirit." This maps to Abraham 3:22 — "the intelligences that were organized." Scripture uses "intelligence" both as a substance (light of truth) and as beings (intelligences). Webster already had both usages.

### Law

**Scriptural Definition (D&C 88:36-42):**
> "All kingdoms have a law given... and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions"
> "He hath given a law unto all things, by which they move in their times and their seasons"
> — [D&C 88:36, 38, 42](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md)

**Properties of Law:**
- **Universal** — given to all kingdoms, all things ([D&C 88:36, 42](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md))
- **Has bounds and conditions** — not arbitrary ([D&C 88:38](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md))
- **Preserving and perfecting** — "that which is governed by law is also preserved by law and perfected and sanctified by the same" ([D&C 88:34](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md))
- **Necessary for existence** — "if ye shall say there is no law, ye shall also say there is no sin... And if there is no God we are not, neither the earth" ([2 Nephi 2:13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.md))
- **Spiritual** — "all things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal" ([D&C 29:34](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.md))

**Webster 1828:** "A rule of being or of conduct, established by an authority able to enforce its will; a controlling regulation; the mode or order according to which an agent or a power acts." In philosophy: "A rule of being, operation, or change, so certain and constant that it is conceived of as imposed by the will of God."

**Key Insight:** Webster's physics definition says law is "so certain and constant that it is conceived of as imposed by the will of God." That's *exactly* the Restoration framework. Mathematics, the laws of physics — these aren't inventions. They're discoveries of what was always there. $E = mc^2$ was true before Einstein wrote it down. $\pi$ was $\pi$ before anyone calculated it. Truth "was not created or made, neither indeed can be."

### Comprehend

**Scriptural Usage (Abraham 4:4):**
> "And they (the Gods) comprehended the light, for it was bright"
> — [Abraham 4:4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/4.md)

**Also (D&C 88:49):**
> "The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not"
> — [D&C 88:49](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md)

**Also (John 1:5):**
> "And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not"
> — [John 1:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/john/1.md)

**Webster 1828:** Three distinct meanings — all relevant:
1. **To contain; to embrace; to include** — physical encompassing
2. **To take in or include by construction or implication** — logical inclusion
3. **To take into the mind; to grasp with the understanding** — mental understanding

**Key Insight:** "The Gods comprehended the light" carries *all three* Webster meanings. They (1) contained it, (2) included it in their creative work, and (3) understood it. Darkness, by contrast, *cannot do any of these* with light. It cannot contain it (light dispels darkness). It cannot include it (they are opposites). It cannot understand it (understanding requires light: "the same light that quickeneth your understandings" — [D&C 88:11](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md)). Comprehension is not merely intellectual — it is **ontological**. To comprehend light, you must be *made of* light. To be darkness is to be structurally incapable of containing what light is.

## Part 2: The Unified Framework

### The Equivalence Statements of D&C 93

D&C 93 establishes a series of equivalences that, taken together, form a unified framework:

| Verse | Equivalence |
|-------|------------|
| v.29 | Intelligence = the light of truth |
| v.36 | Glory of God = intelligence = light and truth |
| v.9 | Christ = the light and the Redeemer = the Spirit of truth |
| v.26 | Spirit of truth = of God; Christ = Spirit of truth |
| v.24 | Truth = knowledge of things as they are, were, and are to come |

This produces a chain:

$$\text{Intelligence} = \text{Light of Truth} = \text{Light and Truth} = \text{Glory of God}$$

And:

$$\text{Spirit of Truth} = \text{Christ} = \text{The Light}$$

The glory of God, intelligence, light, truth, and spirit are not merely related — they are **different names for aspects of the same underlying reality.**

### Truth Cannot Be Created — Only Discovered

D&C 93:29 is explicit: intelligence — the light of truth — "was not created or made, neither indeed can be."

This means:
- **Truth exists independent of any observer.** "All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it" ([D&C 93:30](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)).
- **God does not invent truth — He discovers and organizes it.** The Gods "organized" and "prepared" — they didn't create ex nihilo ([Abraham 4:1](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/4.md)).
- **Mathematical truth is eternal.** $2 + 2 = 4$ was true before there were beings to compute it. The laws of mathematics are laws in the D&C 88 sense — eternal, governing, discovered.
- **The scientific enterprise is sacred.** To discover truth is to discover what "was not created or made" — to learn the language of eternity.

This also means truth has a kind of *agency*: "to act for itself." Truth isn't passive. It operates. It *does* things in its sphere. "Truth abideth and hath no end; and if it be in you it shall abound" ([D&C 88:66](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md)). Truth isn't a static fact sitting in a database — it's a living, acting, abounding force.

### Is Spirit Consciousness?

Let's build this carefully.

**Webster 1828 on spirit:** "Life, or living substance... an intelligence conceived of apart from any physical organization... the intelligent, immaterial and immortal part of man."

**Webster 1828 on consciousness:** "The state of being conscious; knowledge of one's own existence, condition, sensations, mental operations, acts."

**Scripture says:**
1. Spirit is matter, more fine and pure ([D&C 131:7](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131.md))
2. Intelligence (light of truth) acts "for itself" and without it "there is no existence" ([D&C 93:30](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md))
3. Light "quickeneth your understandings" — enables comprehension ([D&C 88:11](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md))
4. "There is a spirit in man; and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding" ([Job 32:8](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/job/32.md))
5. "The spirit and the body are the soul of man" ([D&C 88:15](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md))

So: spirit is the *matter* of awareness — the medium through which intelligence (light of truth) operates and through which understanding (consciousness) is quickened. Spirit is not consciousness itself — it is the **substance** in which consciousness inheres. Like how a brain isn't "thought" but is the physical medium through which thought occurs, spirit is the *refined material medium* through which intelligence acts.

But here's the deeper layer: intelligence "acts for itself" — it has inherent self-direction. Consciousness is "knowledge of one's own existence" (Webster 1828). If intelligence is self-acting and aware of its own sphere, then intelligence *is* the fundamental substrate of consciousness, and spirit *is* the material embodiment of that consciousness.

**The chain:**
$$\text{Intelligence (self-acting truth)} \rightarrow \text{clothed in spirit (fine matter)} \rightarrow \text{clothed in element (physical matter)} = \text{soul}$$

Consciousness isn't spirit. Consciousness is what happens when intelligence operates through spirit. Spirit is the *body* of consciousness — the material medium. Just as the physical body is the tabernacle of the spirit, spirit is the tabernacle of intelligence.

## Part 3: The Matter Spectrum

### The Restoration Collapses Dualism

The great philosophical divide of Western thought — spirit vs. matter, mind vs. body, immaterial vs. material — is collapsed by a single verse:

> "There is no such thing as immaterial matter. All spirit is matter, but it is more fine or pure"
> — [D&C 131:7](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131.md)

This isn't metaphor. This is a declaration about the nature of reality. There is ONE category of stuff — matter — and it exists on a spectrum of refinement:

```
PURER ←————————————————————————————→ LESS PURE

Intelligence → Spirit Matter → Physical Matter (Element)
(light of     (fine, pure,    (tangible, visible,
 truth)        discerned by    discerned by
               purer eyes)     mortal eyes)
```

### The Same Process Creates on Both Levels

This is the user's critical insight: **the same creative process applies to both spiritual and physical creation.** The evidence is overwhelming.

**[Moses 3:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/3.md):**
> "For I, the Lord God, created all things, of which I have spoken, **spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth**"

**[D&C 29:31-32](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.md):**
> "For by the power of my Spirit created I them; yea, all things both spiritual and temporal — **First spiritual, secondly temporal**, which is the beginning of my work; and again, **first temporal, and secondly spiritual**, which is the last of my work"

**[D&C 29:34](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.md):**
> "All things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal"

The pattern:
1. First spiritual creation, then physical creation (beginning of God's work)
2. First physical death, then spiritual redemption (end of God's work)
3. But to God — **there is no distinction.** "All things unto me are spiritual."

Why? Because spirit and element are both matter. They differ in refinement, not in category. The same *laws* govern both. The same *process* creates in both. The "spiritual before temporal" pattern isn't about doing two different kinds of work — it's about working from the finer to the coarser, from the blueprint to the building.

**[Moses 3:9](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/3.md)** confirms this directly:
> "And out of the ground made I, the Lord God, to grow every tree, naturally, that is pleasant to the sight of man; and man could behold it. And it became also **a living soul**. For it **was spiritual in the day that I created it**; for it **remaineth in the sphere in which I, God, created it**"

A tree has a spirit. It was "spiritual in the day that I created it." It "remaineth in the sphere in which I, God, created it." This matches D&C 93:30 — truth is "independent in that sphere in which God has placed it." Even a tree operates within its sphere, acting according to its nature, governed by law.

### The Reverse Is Also True

If the progression goes pure → less pure (spirit creation → physical creation), the reverse also occurs:

- **Purification** — sanctification, being "quickened" ([D&C 88:28-29](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md))  
- **Resurrection** — spirit and element "inseparably connected" at a glorified level ([D&C 93:33](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md))
- **Celestialization** — the earth itself "shall be sanctified... shall be quickened again" ([D&C 88:25-26](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md))

The earth will become a Urim and Thummim — matter refined to the point of transparency to truth ([D&C 130:9](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.md)). Physical matter → glorified matter → matter so pure it reveals all things. The spectrum runs both directions.

---

## Part 4: Law, Mathematics, and Eternity

### Mathematics Is Eternal Law

Consider D&C 88:42:
> "He hath given a law unto all things, by which they move in their times and their seasons"

Mathematical relationships are not human inventions. They are *discoveries* of eternal law. When Euler found $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$, he didn't create that truth — he comprehended it. It existed independent in its sphere, waiting to be discovered.

This parallels the creation accounts perfectly. The Gods didn't create physics — they comprehended and organized according to pre-existing principles:

> "And they (the Gods) **comprehended** the light, for it was bright; and they **divided** the light, or caused it to be divided, from the darkness."
> — [Abraham 4:4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/4.md)

The Gods comprehended light *first*, then acted upon it. Understanding preceded application. Law existed before creation operated under it.

### Law Is the Condition of Existence

Lehi's argument in [2 Nephi 2:13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.md) is the most rigorous philosophical statement in all scripture:

> "And if ye shall say there is no law, ye shall also say there is no sin. If ye shall say there is no sin, ye shall also say there is no righteousness. And if there be no righteousness there be no happiness. And if there be no righteousness nor happiness there be no punishment nor misery. **And if these things are not there is no God. And if there is no God we are not, neither the earth; for there could have been no creation of things, neither to act nor to be acted upon; wherefore, all things must have vanished away.**"

This is a chain of dependency:

$$\text{Law} \rightarrow \text{Opposition} \rightarrow \text{Agency} \rightarrow \text{Existence}$$

Without law, there is no opposition. Without opposition, there is no agency. Without agency, there is no existence. "All things must have vanished away."

D&C 93:30 says the same thing from the other direction: truth and intelligence must be able to "act for itself... otherwise there is no existence."

**Existence requires:**
1. **Law** — the governing principle (the structure)
2. **Truth** — independent reality (the substance)
3. **Agency** — self-acting capacity (the animation)

Remove any one, and "there is no existence."

### All Law Is Spiritual

D&C 29:34-35 eliminates any gap between physical and spiritual law:

> "All things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal; neither any man, nor the children of men; neither Adam, your father, whom I created... for my commandments are spiritual; they are not natural nor temporal, neither carnal nor sensual."

Gravity is spiritual. Thermodynamics is spiritual. Mathematics is spiritual. Not because they don't have physical effects — but because *there is no such thing as a non-spiritual law.* The laws of physics are subsets of eternal spiritual law. When we discover $F = ma$, we are discovering a spiritual truth operating in the physical sphere.

## Part 5: Darkness, Comprehension, and the One-Way Mirror

### The Asymmetry of Light and Darkness

The scriptures present a fundamental asymmetry:

> "The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not"
> — [John 1:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/john/1.md); [D&C 88:49](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md)

> "And they (the Gods) comprehended the light"
> — [Abraham 4:4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/4.md)

> "Light and truth forsake that evil one"
> — [D&C 93:37](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)

Light can comprehend darkness (the Gods understood both light and dark and divided them). Darkness *cannot* comprehend light. This is not a symmetrical relationship. It's a one-way mirror:

| | Comprehends Light | Comprehends Darkness |
|---|---|---|
| **Light** | Yes — intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence | Yes — can perceive and divide darkness |
| **Darkness** | **No** — cannot contain, include, or understand | Yes — dwells in its own sphere |

Why? Because comprehension requires the *quickening of understanding* — and that quickening IS light ([D&C 88:11](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md)). You cannot understand without light. Understanding IS light operating. So darkness, by definition, cannot comprehend. It's not a choice — it's a structural impossibility.

This has a terrifying corollary: the deeper into darkness, the less capacity to *even recognize* light. The darkness cannot comprehend the light — meaning it cannot *perceive what it's missing.* This is why "that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience" ([D&C 93:39](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)). You don't even know what was taken.

### How Light Is Lost

D&C 93:39 identifies *two* mechanisms:
1. **Disobedience** — breaking the law under which light operates
2. **Tradition of fathers** — inherited patterns of darkness

And D&C 93:37 reveals the mechanism: "Light and truth *forsake* that evil one." Light doesn't fight darkness — it *withdraws*. It's not conquered. It leaves. The Spirit withdraws. Truth recedes. Intelligence retreats. And what remains is the absence — darkness — which is structurally incapable of even comprehending what it lost.

This maps precisely to the Nephite pattern in 3 Nephi 2:1-2 from our [Helaman-Ten Virgins study](./helaman-ten-virgins.md): forget → less astonished → hard → blind → disbelieve → rationalize → "the doctrine of Christ was foolish." Each step is light withdrawing. Each step reduces the capacity to see the next step.

## Part 6: The Mechanics of Existence

### Putting It All Together

The unified framework, built from scripture:

**The Eternal Givens** (uncreated, cannot be created or destroyed):
- Truth (knowledge of reality — D&C 93:24)
- Intelligence (light of truth — D&C 93:29)
- Element (eternal matter — D&C 93:33)
- Law (governing principles — D&C 88:36-42)

**The Spectrum of Matter:**
```
Intelligence ←→ Spirit ←→ Physical Element
(purest)         (fine)     (coarse)
```

All matter. Same substance, different refinement. No ontological gap between them.

**The Requirements for Existence** (from 2 Nephi 2:13 and D&C 93:30):
1. Law — structure, governing principles
2. Opposition — duality, the capacity to distinguish
3. Agency — self-action, the power to choose
4. Truth — independent reality in each sphere

Remove any one → "all things must have vanished away."

**The Creative Process** (identical at every level):
1. **Comprehend** — the Gods comprehend the light ([Abraham 4:4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/4.md))
2. **Organize** — they organize existing eternal materials ([Abraham 4:1](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/4.md))
3. **Give law** — assign bounds and conditions ([D&C 88:38](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md))
4. **Watch until obedience** — "watched those things which they had ordered until they obeyed" ([Abraham 4:18](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/4.md))

The same process applies whether creating:
- Spiritual beings from intelligence
- Physical bodies from element
- Worlds from cosmic materials
- Societies from individuals
- Understanding from study

**The Grace Progression** (D&C 93:12-13, 19-20, 28):
> "He received not of the fulness at first, but continued from grace to grace, until he received a fulness" ([D&C 93:13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md))

> "He that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is glorified in truth and knoweth all things" ([D&C 93:28](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md))

Even Christ progressed from grace to grace. The mechanism of progression is: keep commandments → receive truth and light → glorified → know all things. This is the process by which matter is refined — by which intelligence, clothed in spirit, clothed in element, ascends toward fulness.

### The Circle of Existence

```
        INTELLIGENCE (uncreated, self-acting)
              ↓ clothed in
        SPIRIT (fine matter)
              ↓ clothed in
        ELEMENT (physical matter)
              ↓ governed by
           LAW
              ↓ enabling
         AGENCY → OPPOSITION → CHOICE
              ↓ through obedience
      TRUTH AND LIGHT RECEIVED
              ↓ grace for grace
     GLORIFICATION → FULNESS → COMPREHENSION
              ↓ which is
        INTELLIGENCE (now at a higher sphere)
```

The circle completes. Intelligence, acting within law, receiving truth and light through obedience, is glorified and comprehends all things — becoming intelligence at a higher order. This is the path "from grace to grace." This is how "whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection" ([D&C 130:18](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.md)).

## Part 7: Insights and Implications

### 1. Creation Is Organization, Not Manufacturing

The Gods "organized" and "prepared." They worked with eternal materials — intelligence, spirit matter, physical element — that already existed. The creative act isn't making something from nothing. It's comprehending what is, and ordering it according to law.

This is why Abraham 4:4 says the Gods "comprehended the light" *before* they divided it. Understanding precedes action. Blueprint before building. Spiritual before temporal.

### 2. Mathematics IS Scripture

If "all things unto me are spiritual" ([D&C 29:34](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.md)), and law governs all things, and truth "was not created or made, neither indeed can be" — then mathematical truth is *eternal truth.* When we discover mathematical relationships, we are discovering the language of God's law. The elegance of $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$ is not human artistry — it is the inherent beauty of eternal law, comprehended.

### 3. The Scientific Method Is a Form of Revelation

To discover truth (conformity to reality, things as they are) through careful observation and testing is to do what the Gods do: comprehend the light. Science, properly conducted, is the exercise of intelligence comprehending truth in a particular sphere. It is inherently spiritual work, even when the practitioner doesn't recognize it as such.

### 4. Darkness Is Not a Substance — It's an Absence

Light is real. Darkness is the absence of light. Truth is real. Falsehood is the absence of truth ("whatsoever is more or less than this is the spirit of that wicked one who was a **liar** from the beginning" — [D&C 93:25](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)). Good is real. Evil is the privation of good. This is why "light and truth forsake that evil one" — evil doesn't destroy light, light simply *leaves*, and what remains is darkness.

### 5. Consciousness Is Not a Mystery — It's Intelligence Operating Through Spirit

The "hard problem of consciousness" in philosophy asks how subjective experience arises from physical matter. The Restoration answers: it doesn't. Consciousness arises from intelligence (uncreated, self-acting) operating through spirit (fine matter) which is connected to element (physical matter). Consciousness doesn't emerge from neurons — intelligence acts *through* the spirit which is housed in the body. The medium is material at every level. There is no explanatory gap because there is no ontological gap.

### 6. The Spectrum Is Traversable — In Both Directions

Matter can be refined: sanctification, purification, celestialization. The earth itself will be "quickened" and become a Urim and Thummim. Physical bodies will be glorified. This means the spectrum from "coarse" to "pure" is not a permanent sorting — it's a *ladder* that can be climbed. "From grace to grace."

And the reverse: light and truth can be *lost* through disobedience. Refined understanding can coarsen. Spiritual sensitivity can dull. The spectrum runs both ways.

### 7. Time and the Eternal

D&C 88:44 says the heavenly bodies "give light to each other in their times... all these are one year with God, but not with man." Time itself is a function of law operating in a particular sphere. God's reckoning differs from ours. The "set time" of each star and planet operates according to "their times and their seasons" ([D&C 88:42](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md)), governed by law.

Truth is "knowledge of things as they are, and as they **were**, and as they **are to come**" — encompassing all temporal states simultaneously. To have a fulness of truth is to comprehend past, present, and future. Time isn't the *container* of truth — truth *comprehends* time.

## Synthesis: The One Sentence

If we had to reduce the mechanics of existence to one sentence from scripture, it would be this:

> "All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to act for itself, as all intelligence also; **otherwise there is no existence.**"
> — [D&C 93:30](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)

Truth, intelligence, agency, law, and being are not separate things. They are different facets of one eternal reality, without which nothing exists at all.

## Become

1. **Study mathematics as scripture.** When you encounter mathematical beauty, recognize it as the discovery of eternal law. Let it deepen your reverence.

2. **Watch for light withdrawing.** When understanding dims — when scripture feels dry, when prayer feels mechanical, when truth seems "foolish" — recognize it as the pattern of D&C 93:39. The wicked one takes light through disobedience and tradition. The fix is always the same: keep the commandments, receive light and truth, grace for grace.

3. **Treat the spectrum as real.** Spirit is matter. Physical is matter. The distinction is refinement, not category. This means the body is not a prison or an obstacle — it is the *tabernacle of God.* Treat it accordingly.

4. **Practice comprehension.** The Gods "comprehended the light." Comprehension is not passive — it requires the observer to *be made of* light. Study, prayer, and obedience refine the observer. The more refined you become, the more truth you can discern.

5. **Recognize truth as discovered, not created.** In study, in science, in every honest search for understanding — you are uncovering what "was not created or made, neither indeed can be." This is sacred work.
