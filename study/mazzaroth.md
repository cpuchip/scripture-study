## The Mazzaroth in Scripture

### Job 38:31-33 — The Only Mention of "Mazzaroth"

> "Canst thou bind the sweet influences of **Pleiades**, or loose the bands of **Orion**? Canst thou bring forth **Mazzaroth** in his season? or canst thou guide **Arcturus** with his sons? Knowest thou the **ordinances of heaven**? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?"
> — [Job 38:31-33](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/job/38.md)

**What is Mazzaroth?**
- Hebrew: מַזָּרוֹת (*mazzārōṯ*)
- A *hapax legomenon*—appears only once in the Hebrew Bible
- Most scholars interpret it as the **zodiac constellations** or their seasonal procession through the sky
- Some translations render it "constellations," "zodiac," or leave it untranslated
- The related word *mazalot* (מַּזָּלוֹת) appears in [2 Kings 23:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/23.md), referring to constellations that apostate Israel worshipped (which King Josiah condemned)
- The Yiddish phrase "mazel tov" ("good fortune") derives from this root

**Key Insight**: The phrase "**ordinances of heaven**" suggests God established a divinely ordered pattern in the celestial bodies—not for fortune-telling (which is forbidden), but as witnesses of His work and glory.

### Context: God's Questions to Job

God asks Job about the Mazzaroth in a series of questions demonstrating divine power over creation:
- Can you bind Pleiades? (the seven sisters star cluster)
- Can you loose Orion? (the hunter constellation)
- Can you bring forth Mazzaroth in its season? (the zodiac's yearly procession)
- Can you guide Arcturus? (the bright star in Boötes)

The implication: Only God governs the heavens. Their orderly motion testifies of Him.

## Celestial Lights Created for Signs

### Genesis 1:14 — The Purpose of Heavenly Lights

> "And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for **signs**, and for **seasons**, and for days, and years"
> — [Genesis 1:14](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/1.md)

**Hebrew Analysis**:
- "Signs" = *'ōṯōṯ* (אֹתֹת) — the same word used for prophetic signs and covenant signs
- "Seasons" = *môʿăḏîm* (מוֹעֲדִים) — appointed times, festivals, sacred assemblies

The sun, moon, and stars were designed by God to:
1. Mark time (days, years)
2. Govern appointed sacred times (seasons/festivals)
3. Serve as **signs** — witnesses of divine truth

This is not astrology (forbidden in scripture) but rather recognizing God's testimony written in creation.

## The Bridegroom Coming from His Chamber

### Psalm 19:1-6 — The Heavens Declare God's Glory

> "**The heavens declare the glory of God**; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a **tabernacle for the sun**, Which is as a **bridegroom coming out of his chamber**, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race. His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his **circuit** unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof."
> — [Psalm 19:1-6](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/ps/19.md)

**Key Imagery**:
- The heavens "declare" and "utter speech" — they are witnesses
- The sun has a "tabernacle" (dwelling place) in the heavens
- The sun is like a **bridegroom coming out of his chamber** — joyful, radiant, purposeful
- The sun's "circuit" (*tĕqûp̄â* — revolution, return) covers all heaven

**Connection to the Ten Virgins**:
The parable of the ten virgins ([Matthew 25:1-13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/matt/25.md)) awaits the **bridegroom's coming**. Psalm 19 pictures the sun—moving through its celestial circuit—as that bridegroom emerging from his chamber.

If the Mazzaroth (zodiac constellations) represents the sun's yearly path, then the "bridegroom coming out of his chamber" may picture the sun's emergence and journey through these celestial "stations."

## Celestial Witnesses of God's Power

### D&C 88:42-47 — The Stars Roll in Their Glory

> "And again, verily I say unto you, he hath given a law unto all things, by which they move in their times and their seasons; And their courses are fixed, even the courses of the heavens and the earth, which comprehend the earth and all the planets. And they give light to each other in their times and in their seasons, in their minutes, in their hours, in their days, in their weeks, in their months, in their years—all these are one year with God, but not with man. The earth rolls upon her wings, and the sun giveth his light by day, and the moon giveth her light by night, and **the stars also give their light, as they roll upon their wings in their glory, in the midst of the power of God**. Unto what shall I liken these kingdoms, that ye may understand? Behold, all these are kingdoms, and **any man who hath seen any or the least of these hath seen God moving in his majesty and power**."
> — [D&C 88:42-47](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md)

**Key Doctrine**: To see the stars rolling in their courses is to see **God moving in His majesty and power**. The heavens are not random—they testify of divine order.

### Abraham 3:1-4 — Kolob and the Governing Stars

> "And I, Abraham, had the Urim and Thummim... And I saw the stars, that they were very great, and that one of them was nearest unto the throne of God; and there were many great ones which were near unto it; And the Lord said unto me: These are the **governing ones**; and the name of the great one is **Kolob**, because it is near unto me, for I am the Lord thy God: I have set this one to **govern all those which belong to the same order** as that upon which thou standest."
> — [Abraham 3:1-4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.md)

The stars have governing relationships—some are "governing ones" that set the order for others. This suggests a divinely ordered celestial hierarchy.

## Signs of the Second Coming in the Heavens

### D&C 45:39-42, 56 — Signs Shown Forth in the Heavens

> "And it shall come to pass that he that feareth me shall be **looking forth for the great day of the Lord to come**, even for the **signs of the coming of the Son of Man**. And they shall see signs and wonders, for they shall be shown forth in the **heavens above**, and in the earth beneath... the sun shall be **darkened**, and the moon be turned into **blood**, and the **stars fall from heaven**... And at that day, when I shall come in my glory, shall the parable be fulfilled which I spake concerning the **ten virgins**."
> — [D&C 45:39-42, 56](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.md)

**Key Points**:
- The faithful will be "looking forth" for signs
- Signs will be shown in the **heavens above**
- Sun darkened, moon to blood, stars falling
- The ten virgins parable is fulfilled at His coming

### Matthew 24:29-30 — The Sign of the Son of Man

> "Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the **sun be darkened**, and the **moon shall not give her light**, and the **stars shall fall from heaven**, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: And then shall appear the **sign of the Son of man in heaven**: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory."
> — [Matthew 24:29-30](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/matt/24.md)

See also [JS-Matthew 1:33-36](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1.md) for Joseph Smith's inspired expansion.

### Joel 2:30-31 — Wonders in the Heavens

> "And I will shew **wonders in the heavens** and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. The **sun shall be turned into darkness**, and the **moon into blood**, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord come."
> — [Joel 2:30-31](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/joel/2.md)

## Celestial Signs at Christ's First Coming

### Helaman 14:3-6 — Samuel the Lamanite's Prophecy

> "And behold, this will I give unto you for a **sign** at the time of his coming; for behold, there shall be **great lights in heaven**, insomuch that in the night before he cometh there shall be no darkness, insomuch that it shall appear unto man as if it was day... And behold, there shall a **new star** arise, such an one as ye never have beheld; and this also shall be a sign unto you. And behold this is not all, there shall be **many signs and wonders in heaven**."
> — [Helaman 14:3-6](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/14.md)

### 3 Nephi 1:19-21 — The Sign Fulfilled

> "And it came to pass that there was no darkness in all that night, but it was as light as though it was mid-day. And it came to pass that the sun did rise in the morning again, according to its proper order; and they knew that it was the day that the Lord should be born, because of the **sign which had been given**... And it came to pass also that a **new star did appear**, according to the word."
> — [3 Nephi 1:19-21](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1.md)

### Matthew 2:1-2 — The Wise Men Follow the Star

> "Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judæa in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen **his star** in the east, and are come to worship him."
> — [Matthew 2:1-2](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/matt/2.md)

**Pattern**: Christ's first coming was marked by celestial signs (a new star, light through the night). His second coming will likewise be preceded by signs in the heavens.

## Revelation 12 — Celestial Imagery

### Revelation 12:1-3 — The Woman Clothed with the Sun

> "And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a **woman clothed with the sun**, and the **moon under her feet**, and upon her head a **crown of twelve stars**: And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered. And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon..."
> — [Revelation 12:1-3](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/rev/12.md)

The imagery draws on celestial symbolism:
- Clothed with the **sun**
- **Moon** under her feet
- Crown of **twelve stars** (representing the twelve tribes)

Whether this describes an actual celestial configuration or uses celestial imagery symbolically, it shows that heaven uses the language of sun, moon, and stars to communicate prophetic truth.

## The April/May 2000 Celestial Event & Palmyra Temple

### The Palmyra New York Temple Dedication

- **Date**: April 6, 2000
- **Dedicated by**: President Gordon B. Hinckley
- **Significance**:
  - Exactly **170 years** after the Church was organized (April 6, 1830)
  - **180 years** after Joseph Smith's First Vision in the nearby Sacred Grove
  - April 6 is traditionally associated with Christ's birth per [D&C 20:1](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.md)

### The Planetary Alignment of May 2000

According to NASA and astronomical records:

- **May 5, 2000**: The Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn were all within approximately 26° of each other along the ecliptic
- **May 8-10, 2000**: Jupiter, Mercury, and Saturn each reached conjunction with the Sun
- Most of these conjunctions were invisible due to proximity to the Sun's glare
- The planets were moving toward alignment throughout April 2000

**Note**: The exact planetary alignment peaked about a month *after* the temple dedication (May rather than April 6). However, the planets were already gathering toward alignment during April.

### A Sign?

Whether the 2000 planetary alignment constitutes a "sign" is a matter of personal discernment. What we can say scripturally:

1. **God uses celestial events as signs** ([Genesis 1:14](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/1.md), [Helaman 14:5-6](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/14.md), [Matthew 2:2](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/matt/2.md))
2. **The faithful are to watch for signs in the heavens** ([D&C 45:39-40](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.md))
3. **The heavens declare God's glory continuously** ([Psalm 19:1](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/ps/19.md))
4. **Temple dedications are sacred moments** of covenant renewal between God and His people

The convergence of:
- A temple dedication in the cradle of the Restoration
- On the anniversary of Church organization and (traditionally) Christ's birth
- During a period of planetary gathering

...invites reflection, even if we cannot declare it definitively prophetic.

## The "Gospel in the Stars" Theory — A Caution

### What the Theory Claims

Some 19th-century writers (E.W. Bullinger, Joseph Seiss) proposed that God encoded the gospel story in the zodiac constellations:

| Constellation | Proposed Meaning |
|--------------|------------------|
| Virgo | The virgin who bears the promised seed |
| Libra | The price paid, the scales of justice |
| Scorpio | The conflict, the wound of the serpent |
| Sagittarius | The conqueror riding forth |
| Capricorn | The sacrifice slain |
| Aquarius | Living water poured out |
| Pisces | The multitudes blessed |
| Aries | The lamb, the sacrifice |
| Taurus | The coming judge in power |
| Gemini | The dual nature (God and man) |
| Cancer | The gathering/holding secure |
| Leo | The Lion of Judah triumphant |

### Why Caution Is Warranted

This theory:
- Has **no scriptural basis** beyond speculation
- Is **not part of official Church teaching**
- Derives from 19th-century Victorian Protestant writers, not ancient Israelite tradition
- Risks conflating astronomy with astrology (which is forbidden)

The actual Jewish tradition assigned zodiac signs to the 12 tribes of Israel, but even this mapping varies by source and has no prophetic authority.

**Better approach**: Focus on what scripture *actually says* about the heavens declaring God's glory, rather than speculative systems.

## Questions for Further Study

1. **What are the "ordinances of heaven"** that God asks Job about? ([Job 38:33](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/job/38.md))

2. **How do we distinguish legitimate "signs" from superstition?** Scripture endorses watching for celestial signs but forbids astrology and fortune-telling.

3. **What did the Magi know?** How did wise men from the East recognize "his star"? ([Matthew 2:2](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/matt/2.md))

4. **What is the "sign of the Son of man in heaven"?** ([Matthew 24:30](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/matt/24.md)) — Is this a celestial event, or Christ Himself appearing?

5. **Does the bridegroom imagery in Psalm 19 connect to the Second Coming?** The sun emerging from its chamber to run its course through the heavens...

## Summary: What We Know

### Scriptural Certainties
- God created celestial lights for "signs and seasons" ([Genesis 1:14](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/1.md))
- The heavens declare God's glory without words, in every language ([Psalm 19:1-4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/ps/19.md))
- Celestial signs marked Christ's birth ([Helaman 14:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/14.md); [3 Nephi 1:21](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1.md); [Matthew 2:2](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/matt/2.md))
- Celestial signs will precede Christ's Second Coming ([D&C 45:39-42](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.md); [Joel 2:30-31](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/joel/2.md))
- Viewing the stars is seeing "God moving in his majesty" ([D&C 88:47](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md))
- The Mazzaroth (constellations) are part of the "ordinances of heaven" ([Job 38:32-33](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/job/38.md))

### Faithful Speculation (Not Doctrine)
- The yearly procession of constellations may encode divine testimony
- Planetary alignments near sacred events may be meaningful signs
- The "bridegroom from his chamber" imagery may connect celestial and prophetic themes

### What We Should Avoid
- Astrology and fortune-telling (forbidden)
- Claiming certainty where scripture is silent
- Systems that go beyond what God has revealed

*"The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork."*  
— [Psalm 19:1](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/ps/19.md)
