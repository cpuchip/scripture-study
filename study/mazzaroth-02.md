## Introduction

This document expands on [mazzaroth-01.md](mazzaroth-01.md), collecting additional celestial references discovered through deeper searches. The `markdown_link` field in gospel-mcp has been implemented and these links now work directly!

**Core Premise:** God uses celestial bodies not merely as decoration, but as a **covenant communication system**—marking times, seasons, signs, and prophetic events for His children throughout all dispensations.

---

## Part 1: Signs and Appointed Times

The Hebrew word *מוֹעֵד* (moed) means "appointed time" or "sacred assembly." God established celestial bodies specifically to mark these divine appointments:

### The Moon for Seasons

> "He appointed the **moon for seasons**: the sun knoweth his going down." — [Psalms 104:19](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/ps/104.md)

This verse reveals that the moon's primary purpose is to mark *seasons* (Hebrew: מוֹעֲדִים, moedim)—not agricultural seasons, but **appointed sacred times**.

### New Moon Observances

The new moon (חֹדֶשׁ, chodesh) held significant religious importance in ancient Israel:

> "Blow up the trumpet in the **new moon**, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day." — [Psalms 81:3](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/ps/81.md)

Additional new moon references:
- [1 Samuel 20:5,18,24](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/1-sam/20.md) — David and Jonathan's new moon feast
- [2 Kings 4:23](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/4.md) — "Neither new moon, nor sabbath"
- [Ezekiel 46:1,6](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/ezek/46.md) — Temple worship on new moon
- [Amos 8:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/amos/8.md) — New moon observance

### Millennial Worship by Moon Cycles

The new moon calendar continues into the Millennium:

> "And it shall come to pass, that from **one new moon to another**, and from one sabbath to another, shall **all flesh come to worship** before me, saith the Lord." — [Isaiah 66:23](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/isa/66.md)

### The Ordinances of the Moon

Jeremiah connects the moon's ordinances to Israel's eternal covenant:

> "Thus saith the Lord, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and **the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night**... If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the Lord, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever." — [Jeremiah 31:35-36](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/jer/31.md)

**Insight:** The moon's "ordinances" are connected to Israel's covenant status. As long as the moon follows its appointed course, Israel remains God's covenant people.

### Paul's Commentary

Paul acknowledges these observances while clarifying that shadows give way to substance:

> "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the **new moon**, or of the sabbath days: Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ." — [Colossians 2:16-17](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/col/2.md)

---

## Part 2: The Star of Christ's Birth

### Samuel the Lamanite's Prophecy

Five years before Christ's birth, Samuel prophesied:

> "And behold, this will I give unto you for a sign at the time of his coming; for behold, there shall be **great lights in heaven**, insomuch that in the night before he cometh there shall be **no darkness**, insomuch that it shall appear unto man as if it was day." — [Helaman 14:3](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/14.md)

> "And behold, there shall **a new star arise**, such an one as ye never have beheld; and this also shall be a sign unto you." — [Helaman 14:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/14.md)

### The Wise Men Follow the Star

> "Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judæa in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his **star in the east**, and are come to worship him." — [Matthew 2:1-2](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/matt/2.md)

> "Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired of them diligently **what time the star appeared**." — [Matthew 2:7](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/matt/2.md)

**Insight:** The wise men knew to look for a specific star because they understood prophetic astronomy. Samuel's prophecy shows this knowledge wasn't limited to the Eastern magi—the Nephites also knew to watch for celestial signs.

### Conference Talk: Elder Christofferson on Worship

Elder D. Todd Christofferson used the star of Bethlehem to illustrate true worship:

> "Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to *worship him*." — [Worship, April 2025](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2025/04/35christofferson.md)

---

## Part 3: Christ as the Morning Star

### The Promise to Overcomers

> "And I will give him the **morning star**." — [Revelation 2:28](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/rev/2.md)

### Christ's Self-Identification

> "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the **bright and morning star**." — [Revelation 22:16](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/rev/22.md)

**Insight:** Christ identifies Himself as the morning star—the herald of dawn, the light that announces the coming day. Venus, the brightest object in the pre-dawn sky, has long been associated with this imagery.

---

## Part 4: Sun and Moon Miracles

### Joshua's Long Day

> "And the **sun stood still**, and the **moon stayed**, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies... So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day." — [Joshua 10:12-13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/josh/10.md)

### Habakkuk's Account

> "The **sun and moon stood still** in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear." — [Habakkuk 3:11](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/hab/3.md)

**Insight:** God demonstrated His power over celestial bodies when Israel needed more daylight for battle. The cosmos serves divine purposes, not the other way around.

---

## Part 5: The Firmament

### Creation Accounts

The firmament (Hebrew: רָקִיעַ, raqia) is the expanse in which celestial bodies are placed:

> "And God said, Let there be a **firmament** in the midst of the waters... And God called the firmament Heaven." — [Genesis 1:6-8](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/1.md)

> "And God said, Let there be **lights in the firmament** of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for **signs**, and for **seasons**, and for **days**, and **years**." — [Genesis 1:14](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/1.md)

Parallel accounts:
- [Moses 2:6-8,14-17](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/2.md)
- [Abraham 4:6-8,14-17](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/4.md)

### The Firmament Declares

> "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the **firmament sheweth his handywork**." — [Psalms 19:1](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/ps/19.md)

### Praise in the Firmament

> "Praise ye the Lord. Praise God in his sanctuary: **praise him in the firmament** of his power." — [Psalms 150:1](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/ps/150.md)

### The Wise Shine as the Firmament

> "And they that be wise shall **shine as the brightness of the firmament**; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever." — [Daniel 12:3](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/dan/12.md)

**Insight:** Those who teach righteousness become like stars themselves—celestial beacons guiding others to Christ.

### Lehi's Vision

> "And he also saw One descending out of the midst of heaven, and he beheld that his luster was above that of the sun at noon-day. And he also saw twelve others following him, and their **brightness did exceed that of the stars in the firmament**." — [1 Nephi 1:9-10](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1.md)

---

## Part 6: Celestial Signs of the Second Coming

### Expanded Second Coming References

Beyond those covered in [mazzaroth-01.md](mazzaroth-01.md):

> "The **sun and the moon shall be darkened**, and the **stars shall withdraw their shining**." — [Joel 3:15](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/joel/3.md)

> "The **sun shall be turned into darkness**, and the **moon into blood**, before that great and notable day of the Lord come." — [Acts 2:20](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/acts/2.md)

> "Then shall the moon be confounded, and the **sun ashamed**, when the Lord of hosts shall reign in mount Zion." — [Isaiah 24:23](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/isa/24.md)

> "And then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven... For the **sun shall be darkened**, and the **moon shall not give her light**, and the **stars shall fall from heaven**." — [D&C 45:40-42](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.md)

> "But in those days, after that tribulation, the **sun shall be darkened**, and the **moon shall not give her light**, and the **stars of heaven shall fall**." — [Mark 13:24-25](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/mark/13.md)

### The Woman Clothed with the Sun

> "And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a **woman clothed with the sun**, and the **moon under her feet**, and upon her head **a crown of twelve stars**." — [Revelation 12:1](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/rev/12.md)

**Insight:** The Church is depicted using celestial imagery—clothed in glory (sun), standing on covenant foundations (moon), crowned with apostolic authority (twelve stars).

---

## Part 7: The Church "Fair as the Moon, Clear as the Sun"

This striking phrase appears multiple times, describing the Church coming forth:

### Song of Solomon

> "Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, **fair as the moon, clear as the sun**, and terrible as an army with banners?" — [Song of Solomon 6:10](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/song/6.md)

### Restoration of the Church

> "And after this day of testimony... even the **beginning of the rising up and the coming forth of my church** out of the wilderness—**clear as the moon, and fair as the sun**, and terrible as an army with banners." — [D&C 5:14](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/5.md)

### Kirtland Temple Dedication

> "That thy church may come forth out of the wilderness of darkness, and shine forth **fair as the moon, clear as the sun**, and terrible as an army with banners." — [D&C 109:73](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109.md)

### Zion's Army

> "But first let my army become very great, and let it be sanctified before me, that it may become **fair as the sun, and clear as the moon**, and that her banners may be terrible unto all nations." — [D&C 105:31](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.md)

**Insight:** The Church is described in celestial terms—reflecting light (like the moon reflects sunlight), radiating truth (like the sun), and moving with purpose (like a disciplined army). This imagery connects the Church to the broader celestial witness system.

---

## Part 8: Kolob and Divine Time

### Kolob: The Great Governing Star

> "And I saw the stars, that they were very great, and that one of them was nearest unto the throne of God; and there were many great ones which were near unto it; And the Lord said unto me: These are the **governing ones**; and the name of the great one is **Kolob**, because it is near unto me." — [Abraham 3:2-3](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.md)

### Kolob's Time = God's Time

> "And the Lord said unto me, by the Urim and Thummim, that Kolob was after the manner of the Lord, according to its times and seasons in the revolutions thereof; that **one revolution was a day unto the Lord**, after his manner of reckoning, it being **one thousand years** according to the time appointed unto that whereon thou standest." — [Abraham 3:4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.md)

> "And thus there shall be the reckoning of the time of **one planet above another**, until thou come nigh unto Kolob... which Kolob is set nigh unto the throne of God, to govern all those planets which belong to the same order as that upon which thou standest." — [Abraham 3:9](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.md)

> "Now the set time of the lesser light is a longer time as to its reckoning than the reckoning of the time of the earth upon which thou standest... This is in **the order of Kolob, for Kolob is after the reckoning of the Lord's time**." — [Abraham 3:6,9](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.md)

**Insight:** Abraham learned that celestial bodies operate on different time scales, with Kolob representing God's time. This explains 2 Peter 3:8: "one day is with the Lord as a thousand years."

### Conference Reference

> "If you could hie to Kolob..." — Elder Russell M. Nelson referenced this hymn in ["Decisions for Eternity," October 2013](../gospel-library/eng/liahona/2013/11/sunday-afternoon-session/decisions-for-eternity.md), connecting our daily choices to eternal realities.

---

## Part 9: Day, Night, and Eternal Light

### The Rhythm of Creation

> "And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day." — [Genesis 1:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/1.md)

> "And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also." — [Genesis 1:16](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/1.md)

### God Owns Both Day and Night

> "The **day is thine, the night also is thine**: thou hast prepared the light and the sun." — [Psalms 74:16](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/ps/74.md)

> "Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the **night shineth as the day**: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee." — [Psalms 139:12](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/ps/139.md)

### Children of Light

> "Ye are all the **children of light**, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness." — [1 Thessalonians 5:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/1-thes/5.md)

> "The **night is far spent, the day is at hand**: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light." — [Romans 13:12](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/rom/13.md)

### Zechariah's Millennial Prophecy

> "But it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord, **not day, nor night**: but it shall come to pass, that at **evening time it shall be light**." — [Zechariah 14:7](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/zech/14.md)

**Insight:** In the Millennium, the normal day/night cycle will be superseded. This parallels Samuel's prophecy of "one day and a night and a day, as if it were one day" at Christ's birth (Helaman 14:4).

### Celestial Motion

> "The earth rolls upon her wings, and **the sun giveth his light by day**, and **the moon giveth her light by night**, and **the stars also give their light**, as they roll upon their wings in their glory, in the midst of the power of God." — [D&C 88:45](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.md)

---

## Part 10: Temple Symbolism

### Nauvoo Temple Celestial Stones

The Nauvoo Temple featured carved moonstones, sunstones, and starstones:

> "The exterior was ornamented with intricately carved **moonstones, sunstones, and starstones**, while sunlight streaming through the many windows illuminated the interior." — [Teachings of Joseph Smith, Chapter 44](../gospel-library/eng/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-44.md)

### Salt Lake Temple Constellations

The Salt Lake Temple features the Big Dipper constellation (Ursa Major) pointing to the North Star on its west towers:

> "See here," he said, pointing to a window on the west center tower... "That's the Big Dipper, or Ursa Major, with the pointers pointing to the North Star. 'The lost may find themselves by the priesthood' was the explanation given by the workmen at the time." — [Every Window, Every Spire Speaks of the Things of God](../gospel-library/eng/liahona/1993/11/every-window-every-spire-speaks-of-the-things-of-god.md)

**Insight:** Temple architecture incorporates celestial symbolism, connecting heaven and earth. The priesthood is likened to the North Star—a fixed reference point by which the lost can find their way.

---

## Part 11: The Heavenly Host

### The Announcement of Christ's Birth

> "And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the **heavenly host** praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men." — [Luke 2:13-14](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/luke/2.md)

**Insight:** The "heavenly host" (צְבָא הַשָּׁמַיִם) can refer to both angelic beings and celestial bodies. At Christ's birth, both witnessed: angels sang and a new star appeared.

---

## Part 12: Pillar of Fire by Night

God used celestial imagery to guide Israel:

> "And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a **pillar of fire**, to give them light; to go by day and night." — [Exodus 13:21](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/ex/13.md)

> "Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a **pillar of fire**, to give them light in the way wherein they should go." — [Nehemiah 9:12](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/neh/9.md)

**Insight:** God provided His own "celestial light" when leading Israel—a pillar that served the same function as sun by day and stars by night: illumination for the journey.

---

## Part 13: Spiritual Eclipse

### Conference Teaching

President Dieter F. Uchtdorf used the eclipse as a teaching metaphor:

> "Friends and family of mine who were in the zone of total eclipse described how light was replaced by darkness, the stars appeared, and birds quit singing." — [Spiritual Eclipse, October 2017](../gospel-library/eng/liahona/2017/11/saturday-afternoon-session/spiritual-eclipse.md)

> "He will coerce us to create our own eclipse; he will push us into the darkness of his cavern." — [Bearers of Heavenly Light, October 2017](../gospel-library/eng/liahona/2017/11/general-priesthood-session/bearers-of-heavenly-light.md)

Elder Neil L. Andersen used similar imagery:

> "Like an eclipse of the sun, they had blocked the light of *the* Son, and the result was an eclipse of hope." — [The Triumph of Hope, October 2024](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2024/10/12andersen.md)

**Insight:** An eclipse occurs when something comes between us and the source of light. Spiritually, anything that blocks our view of Christ creates darkness.

---

## Summary: The Celestial Communication System

These additional scriptures reinforce the themes from [mazzaroth-01.md](mazzaroth-01.md):

1. **Appointed Times:** The moon marks sacred assemblies (moedim), not just months
2. **Signs Given:** Celestial events herald Christ—His birth (star) and return (darkened sun/moon)
3. **Christ as Light:** He is the Morning Star, the Light of the World
4. **Temple Connection:** Sacred architecture reflects celestial patterns
5. **Covenant Permanence:** As long as moon and sun endure, so does God's covenant
6. **Church Identity:** The Church is described in celestial terms (fair as moon, clear as sun)
7. **Kolob's Witness:** Divine time differs from earthly time, centered on Kolob
