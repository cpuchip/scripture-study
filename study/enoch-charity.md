# Faith, Hope, and Charity: The Architecture of Zion

*A study connecting Enoch's story with the triad that builds Zion*

> "And faith, hope, charity and love, with an eye single to the glory of God, qualify him for the work." — [D&C 4:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.md)

---

## The Connection

In studying [Enoch](enoch.md), we found a man whose "heart swelled wide as eternity" and whose "bowels yearned" as he wept with God ([Moses 7:41](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)).

In studying [charity](charity.md), we found that the Lord commands us: "Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men" ([D&C 121:45](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.md)).

The same language. The same visceral, whole-being love. Enoch didn't just *feel sorry* for the wicked — his bowels *yearned*. The Lord doesn't just ask us to *be nice* — He asks for bowels *full of charity*.

And then there's the seeing. In our charity study, the key personal insight was: *"I found myself praying to see others as Christ sees them."* In Enoch's story, God told him to anoint his eyes with clay and wash them — and "he beheld the spirits that God had created; and he beheld also things which were not visible to the natural eye" ([Moses 6:35–36](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)).

Charity is the lens. Faith is the foundation. Hope is what keeps us building. All three together are the architecture of Zion.

## I. The Triad in Scripture

### The Scriptural Chain

The Book of Mormon presents faith, hope, and charity not as three separate virtues but as an *inseparable chain* — each requiring and producing the others:

> "Wherefore, there must be **faith**; and if there must be faith there must also be **hope**; and if there must be hope there must also be **charity**." — [Moroni 10:20](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.md)

> "And except ye have charity ye can in nowise be saved in the kingdom of God; neither can ye be saved in the kingdom of God if ye have not faith; neither can ye if ye have no hope." — [Moroni 10:21](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.md)

Remove any one and the whole structure collapses. They are like a three-legged stool — as President Uchtdorf described:

> "Hope is one leg of a three-legged stool, together with faith and charity. These three stabilize our lives regardless of the rough or uneven surfaces we might encounter at the time." — [President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, "The Infinite Power of Hope," October 2008](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2008/10/the-infinite-power-of-hope.md)

### The Interplay

Moroni and Mormon lay out the internal mechanics:

| Connection | Scripture | Meaning |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Faith → Hope** | "If a man have faith he must needs have hope; for without faith there cannot be any hope" ([Moroni 7:42](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.md)) | Faith in Christ naturally generates hope for the future |
| **Hope → Faith** | "Faith is things which are hoped for and not seen" ([Ether 12:6](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.md)) | Hope fuels faith by giving it an object |
| **Faith + Hope → Charity** | "If a man be meek and lowly in heart... he must needs have charity" ([Moroni 7:44](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.md)) | Genuine faith and hope produce love as their fruit |
| **Charity → Salvation** | "Except men shall have charity they cannot inherit that place" ([Ether 12:34](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.md)) | Charity is the final qualification for God's kingdom |

Ether 12:28 captures the triad's ultimate destination:

> "Faith, hope and charity **bringeth unto me** — the **fountain of all righteousness.**" — [Ether 12:28](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.md)

The triad doesn't just make us better people. It brings us *to Christ*. And Christ is the fountain from which Zion flows.

### The Walk Connection

Here is something remarkable. Mormon, in introducing his great sermon on faith, hope, and charity, uses *walking* language:

> "And now my brethren, I judge these things of you because of your **peaceable walk** with the children of men." — [Moroni 7:4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.md)

A *peaceable walk*. These people were walking peaceably because they had faith, hope, and charity. And what did God say to Enoch? **"Walk with me"** ([Moses 6:34](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)). The 1828 Webster's defines walking with God as *"to live in obedience to his commands, and have communion with him."*

Walking with God produces the peaceable walk that Mormon observed. The invitation in Moses 6 leads to the result in Moroni 7.

---

## II. Faith in Enoch's Story

### Enoch's Faith Was the Foundation

Everything in Enoch's story begins with faith. Consider the sequence:

**1. Faith to obey despite fear:**
Enoch was "but a lad" who was hated and slow of speech ([Moses 6:31](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)). He went anyway. Faith precedes the miracle — always.

**2. Faith to see:**
After anointing his eyes, Enoch "beheld the spirits that God had created" and "things which were not visible to the natural eye" ([Moses 6:36](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)). This is exactly Ether's teaching: "Faith is things which are hoped for and **not seen**" ([Ether 12:6](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.md)). Enoch's faith preceded his seeing.

**3. Faith to move mountains — literally:**
> "So great was the faith of Enoch that he led the people of God, and their enemies came to battle against them; and he spake the word of the Lord, and the earth trembled, and the **mountains fled**, even according to his command; and the **rivers of water were turned out of their course.**" — [Moses 7:13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)

Compare this to Ether 12:30: "The brother of Jared said unto the mountain Zerin, Remove — and it was removed." Enoch and the brother of Jared share the same faith that moves mountains. And Moroni connects this directly to the triad: his teaching on mountain-moving faith leads immediately into his teaching on hope and charity ([Ether 12:28–34](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.md)).

**4. Faith unto translation:**
> "By faith Enoch was **translated** that he should not see death... for before his translation he had this testimony, that **he pleased God.**" — [Hebrews 11:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/heb/11.md)

And then Paul adds the definition that unlocks everything:

> "But without **faith** it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that **he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.**" — [Hebrews 11:6](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/heb/11.md)

Enoch pleased God through faith. His entire arc — from reluctant boy to translated prophet — was built on the foundation of believing God and acting on that belief.

### Faith Taught from Adam

Faith wasn't invented by Enoch. It was handed down from the beginning:

> "And they were preachers of righteousness, and spake and prophesied, and called upon all men, everywhere, to repent; and **faith was taught unto the children of men.**" — [Moses 6:23](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)

Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared — each one taught faith to the next. Enoch inherited this legacy. "Jared taught Enoch in all the ways of God" ([Moses 6:21](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)). The first leg of the stool was placed by Adam himself.

---

## III. Hope in Enoch's Story

### Hope in the Face of Wickedness

Enoch preached in a world where "Satan had great dominion among men" and "a man's hand was against his own brother" ([Moses 6:15](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)). To preach righteousness in such a world requires not just faith but *hope* — the conviction that things can be different.

Hope is, as Mormon taught, anticipation of life eternal "through the atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection" ([Moroni 7:41](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.md)). But hope also operates in the present tense: *hope that a Zion people can actually be built.* Hope that God's promises will be fulfilled.

> "If ye have no hope ye must needs be in **despair**; and despair cometh because of iniquity." — [Moroni 10:22](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.md)

Enoch's world was *full* of iniquity — and therefore full of despair. His message was the antidote: hope in Christ, hope of repentance, hope of a community of the pure in heart.

### Hope That Sustained the Building

Zion wasn't built in a day. Moses 7:21 says it was taken up "**in process of time.**" Three hundred and sixty-five years of daily faithfulness ([D&C 107:49](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.md)). That kind of endurance requires hope.

Nephi describes the path:

> "Ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a **perfect brightness of hope**, and a **love of God and of all men.**" — [2 Nephi 31:20](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.md)

*Steadfastness.* *Perfect brightness of hope.* *Love of God and of all men.* There's the triad again: faith (steadfastness in Christ), hope (perfect brightness), and charity (love of God and all men). Press forward. This is how Enoch built for 365 years without giving up.

President Uchtdorf explained the mechanics:

> "Hope is critical to both faith and charity. When disobedience, disappointment, and procrastination erode faith, hope is there to uphold our faith. When frustration and impatience challenge charity, hope braces our resolve and urges us to care for our fellowmen even without expectation of reward. The brighter our hope, the greater our faith. The stronger our hope, the purer our charity." — [President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, "The Infinite Power of Hope," October 2008](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2008/10/the-infinite-power-of-hope.md)

This is key for understanding how Zion endures. There must have been days when Enoch's people were exhausted, when unity felt hard, when caring for the poor felt endless. *Hope* is what held it together.

### The Ultimate Hope: The Reunion

Enoch's hope was rewarded with a breathtaking vision:

> "Then shalt thou and all thy city **meet them** there, and we will receive them into our bosom, and they shall see us; and we will **fall upon their necks**, and they shall **fall upon our necks**, and we will **kiss each other.**" — [Moses 7:63](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)

Ancient Zion and latter-day Zion embracing across millennia. *This* is hope fulfilled. And Ether taught that without such hope, "man must hope, or he cannot receive an inheritance in the place which thou hast prepared" ([Ether 12:32](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.md)).

---

## IV. Charity in Enoch's Story

### Charity Built Zion

The definition of Zion is, at its core, a description of charity in communal form:

> "They were of **one heart and one mind**, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was **no poor among them.**" — [Moses 7:18](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)

Now read Mormon's description of charity:

> "Charity suffereth long, and is kind, and **envieth not**, and is not puffed up, **seeketh not her own**, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things." — [Moroni 7:45](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.md)

| Charity (Moroni 7:45) | Zion (Moses 7:18) |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Envieth not | One heart — no jealousy, no competition |
| Seeketh not her own | No poor among them — you share everything |
| Is not puffed up | One mind — no class hierarchy |
| Suffereth long, is kind | Dwelt in righteousness — patient, consistent holiness |
| Beareth all things, endureth all things | "In process of time" — 365 years of endurance |

**Zion is what charity looks like when an entire people lives it.** Charity isn't just a personal virtue — it's the operating system of a Zion society. Without it, Zion cannot exist.

### The Weeping God: What Divine Charity Looks Like

The scene in Moses 7:28–41 is the most profound display of charity in all scripture. God Himself models the pure love of Christ — *literally*:

> "The God of heaven looked upon the residue of the people, and **he wept.**" — [Moses 7:28](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)

And why?

> "They are the **workmanship of mine own hands**, and I gave unto them their knowledge... and unto thy brethren have I said... that they should **love** one another, and that they should **choose me**, their Father; but behold, they are without affection, and they **hate** their own blood." — [Moses 7:32–33](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)

God's weeping is charity: the pure love of a Father for His children, sustained even when His children reject Him. He doesn't stop loving because they stopped choosing. He weeps.

And Enoch, having walked with God, enters that same love:

> "His **heart swelled wide as eternity**; and his **bowels yearned**; and all eternity shook." — [Moses 7:41](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)

Compare D&C 121:45:

> "Let thy **bowels** also be full of **charity** towards all men."

Enoch's bowels yearned because they were full of charity. He had obtained what Mormon would later describe: "the pure love of Christ" ([Moroni 7:47](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.md)). And Mormon taught how to obtain it:

> "Pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be **filled** with this love, which **he hath bestowed** upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ." — [Moroni 7:48](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.md)

Charity isn't manufactured. It's *bestowed*. It's a gift from God — the same God whose own charity caused Him to weep. When Enoch prayed and walked with God for 365 years, he received this gift. His heart literally became like God's heart.

### Charity: No Poor Among Them

The practical expression of charity in Zion was economic: *"There was no poor among them"* ([Moses 7:18](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)). This wasn't socialism or government mandate — it was love made material.

The early Saints failed at this:

> "They... do not impart of their substance, as becometh saints, to the poor and afflicted among them." — [D&C 105:3](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.md)

President Romney connected this directly to Enoch and to love:

> "As we prepare for the building of Zion, we must not and we shall not abandon the basic principles upon which our Church Welfare Services are founded: *love* — love of God and neighbor — and *work,* or labor." — [President Marion G. Romney, "Church Welfare Services' Basic Principles," April 1976](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/1976/04/church-welfare-services-basic-principles.md)

You cannot have "no poor" without charity. And you cannot have charity without faith and hope. The triad holds.

### The Nephite Parallel

The 4 Nephi Zion confirms the same pattern:

> "There was no contention in the land, because of the **love of God** which did dwell in the hearts of the people." — [4 Nephi 1:15](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.md)

The love of God = charity = pure love of Christ. It *dwelt in their hearts*. And the result was no contention, no envy, no classes, no poor — all the characteristics of Moroni 7:45 lived out at societal scale.

And it fell when that love departed. Pride, costly apparel, "no more common in goods," churches built "to get gain" ([4 Nephi 1:24–26](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.md)). When charity left, Zion collapsed.

---

## V. The Triad Builds Zion: Mapping the Architecture

Elder Christofferson identified three pillars of Zion in his talk "Come to Zion." Each maps directly to the triad:

| Pillar of Zion | Christofferson's Teaching | Triad Element |
|----------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| **Unity** — one heart and one mind | "It is not enough to be *nice*; we must be *one* ... forgiveness is essential" | **Charity** — "envieth not, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked" |
| **Holiness** — dwelt in righteousness | "Let us once and for all establish our residence in Zion and give up the summer cottage in Babylon" (Maxwell) | **Faith** — believing God enough to abandon the world's ways entirely |
| **Caring for the poor** — no poor among them | "We cannot wait until Zion comes for these things to happen — Zion will come only as they happen" | **Hope** — the forward-looking conviction that giving now produces Zion later |

Source: [Elder D. Todd Christofferson, "Come to Zion," October 2008](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2008/10/come-to-zion.md)

But the mapping isn't rigid — all three virtues support all three pillars. You need *faith* to believe unity is possible, *hope* to sustain it through conflict, and *charity* to actually practice it. You need *faith* to choose holiness, *hope* that it matters eternally, and *charity* to do it joyfully. You need *faith* that God will provide, *hope* in the outcome, and *charity* to actually give.

### The D&C 121:45 Connection

The priesthood passage that we referenced in our charity study reveals the full cascade:

> "Let thy bowels also be full of **charity** towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let **virtue** garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy **confidence** wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven." — [D&C 121:45](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.md)

Charity → virtue → confidence → priesthood power → dominion "without compulsory means" ([D&C 121:46](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.md)). This is how Enoch led: not by force but by love. His people *chose* unity. His people *chose* to have no poor among them. Their dominion flowed unto them because they had charity.

### The D&C 4:5 Template

The Lord gave the complete Zion-builder's qualification list in the very first section revelation about missionary work:

> "And **faith, hope, charity** and love, with an eye single to the glory of God, **qualify him for the work.**" — [D&C 4:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.md)

And then the expanded list:

> "Remember **faith**, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, **charity**, humility, diligence." — [D&C 4:6](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.md)

Faith bookends the beginning; charity bookends near the end. These are the qualifications for building Zion — the same qualities Enoch lived for 365 years.

---

## VI. Charity and Sight: Seers, Seeing, and the Pure Love of Christ

### Enoch's Anointed Eyes

When Enoch anointed his eyes with clay, "he beheld the spirits that God had created; and he beheld also things which were not visible to the natural eye; and from thenceforth came the saying abroad in the land: **A seer hath the Lord raised up unto his people**" ([Moses 6:36](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)).

In our charity study, we noted that praying for charity led to praying *to see others as Christ sees them*. Seership and charity are connected at the root: both are about seeing what is invisible to the natural eye. The seer beholds spiritual realities. The person filled with charity beholds the divine worth of every soul.

When President Eyring, as a bishop, was shown a wayward member as God saw him — a "bright, noble son of God" — that was both seership and charity working together. You cannot truly love someone you cannot see. And you cannot truly *see* someone without love.

### Was Adam the First Seer?

The [Enoch study](enoch.md) called Enoch "the first recorded seer in scripture." But is that precise? Let's look at what Adam did:

- Adam "conversed" with God Himself ([Moses 6:22](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md))
- Adam was "filled, and began to **prophesy** concerning all the families of the earth" ([Moses 5:10](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.md))
- Adam "stood up in the midst of the congregation... and **predicted whatsoever should befall his posterity unto the latest generation**" ([D&C 107:56](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.md))
- Adam's "eyes are opened" through the Fall ([Moses 5:10](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.md))

Now compare Ammon's definition of a seer:

> "A **seer** is a revelator and a prophet also; and a gift which is greater can no man have... But a seer can know of things which are **past**, and also of things which are **to come**, and by them shall all things be revealed, or, rather, shall secret things be made manifest, and hidden things shall come to light, and **things which are not known shall be made known by them.**" — [Mosiah 8:16–17](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/8.md)

Adam predicted the future of all his posterity to the latest generation. He prophesied concerning all the families of the earth. He communed directly with God. By Ammon's definition, Adam was clearly a seer.

And indeed, we sustain every prophet from Adam forward as prophet, seer, and revelator. Elder Shirley D. Christensen taught:

> "The role of prophets is to teach of Christ and testify of His divinity and His mission. **Adam, the first prophet**, with his wife, Eve, heard the voice of the Lord and initiated the pattern for the dispensations that would follow." — [Elder Shirley D. Christensen, "The Clarion Call of Prophets," October 2003](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2003/10/the-clarion-call-of-prophets.md)

### What Moses 6:36 Actually Says

The text is precise: "from thenceforth came **the saying** abroad in the land: A seer hath the Lord raised up unto his people."

It doesn't say Enoch was the first person to have the gift of seership. It says the *public recognition* — "the saying abroad in the land" — began with Enoch. The *title* became known through him. **Adam had the gift; Enoch made it famous.**

Why? Perhaps because Adam's prophetic ministry happened within familiar, family settings — conversations with God, blessings pronounced at Adam-ondi-Ahman ([D&C 107:53–56](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.md)). But Enoch's was public and dramatic: anointing eyes with clay, seeing the invisible, preaching among hostile strangers. The *people* — not God — named him seer. It was their recognition of a gift that had existed since Adam.

This matters because it shows that **Zion's gifts have always been present in the priesthood line from Adam.** The tools to build Zion — faith, prophecy, seership, charity — were not innovations of Enoch's generation. They were inherited from the beginning and will be restored at the end. "Now this same Priesthood, which was in the beginning, shall be in the end of the world also" ([Moses 6:7](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)).

### Seership as a Form of Charity

Ammon also taught: "A seer can know of things which are past, and also of things which are to come" and "things which are not known shall be made known by them, and also things shall be made known by them which otherwise could not be known" ([Mosiah 8:17](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/8.md)).

Then he added the purpose:

> "Thus God has provided a means that man, through faith, might work mighty miracles; therefore he **becometh a great benefit to his fellow beings.**" — [Mosiah 8:18](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/8.md)

Seership serves others. It is a form of charity — using divine sight for the benefit of "fellow beings." Enoch's seership wasn't for personal glory. It was for building a people. It was charity expressed through prophetic vision.

And the king recognized the precedence of the seer's gift:

> "The king said that a **seer is greater than a prophet.**" — [Mosiah 8:15](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/8.md)

Greater — because a seer *sees*. And seeing leads to building. You can't build Zion if you can't see it.

---

## VII. President Eyring and Sisters in Zion

President Eyring's October 2020 talk "Sisters in Zion" ties every thread of this study together — Enoch, charity, the triad, and Zion. He quoted the full Moses 7:62–64 prophecy and then said:

> "This dispensation is distinct in that the Lord will lead us to become prepared to be like the city of Enoch." — [President Henry B. Eyring, "Sisters in Zion," October 2020](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2020/10/35eyring.md)

And then he connected it directly to charity:

> "**Charity** is the pure love of Christ. And it is **faith** in Him and the full effects of His infinite Atonement that will qualify you, and those you love and serve, for the supernal gift to live in that sociality of a long-looked-for and promised **Zion.**" — [President Henry B. Eyring, "Sisters in Zion," October 2020](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2020/10/35eyring.md)

Faith and charity. Qualification for Zion. President Eyring saw it as inseparable: faith in Christ + charity toward others = Zion.

He also shared his personal witness of what early Zion looks like — watching the Relief Society sisters in his childhood branch love and lift each other unfailingly:

> "I watched my mother and those sisters love, lift, and care for each other unfailingly. I realize now that I was given an early glimpse of Zion." — [President Henry B. Eyring, "Sisters in Zion," October 2020](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2020/10/35eyring.md)

*An early glimpse of Zion.* Not a grand city. Not a miraculous translation. Just a handful of sisters caring for each other with Christ-like love. That is where Zion begins.

## VIII. Practical Application: Building the Triad in the Family

### The Family Zion Checklist (Faith, Hope, Charity)

| Triad Element | What It Looks Like in a Family |
|--------------|-------------------------------|
| **Faith** | Family scripture study that actually engages the text. Family prayer that trusts God to answer. Obedience to covenant commitments even when it costs. Choosing to follow prophetic counsel over cultural pressure. |
| **Hope** | Speaking with optimism about the future. Refusing despair when children struggle. Looking forward to temple blessings. Talking openly about the Second Coming with confidence, not anxiety. |
| **Charity** | Seeing each family member as God sees them. Forgiving quickly. Not keeping score. Serving without expectation. Letting your bowels yearn for your children as Enoch's yearned for the world. |

### The Moroni 7:45 Family Test

Read [Moroni 7:45](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.md) as a household audit:

- **Suffereth long** — Do I endure my family's weaknesses with patience?
- **Is kind** — Am I kind in tone, not just in content?
- **Envieth not** — Am I jealous of my spouse's strengths or celebrate them?
- **Is not puffed up** — Do I need to be right, or do I need to be one?
- **Seeketh not her own** — Whose needs am I serving at home?
- **Is not easily provoked** — How quickly do I snap?
- **Thinketh no evil** — Do I assume the best about my family's motives?
- **Beareth all things** — Am I willing to carry burdens that aren't "mine"?
- **Endureth all things** — Will I stay the course, "in process of time"?

This is the Zion checklist. This is how Enoch's people lived for 365 years. Not by grand gestures, but by daily choices to love as Christ loves.

```

Enoch was told to **walk** with God. Mormon saw the **peaceable walk** of the charitable. Nephi said to **press forward** with hope and love. Paul said Enoch **walked** with God by faith and was translated. It's all walking. It's all the same invitation.

**Faith** is the foundation that lets you start walking.  
**Hope** is the endurance that keeps you walking.  
**Charity** is the love that you walk *with* and walk *toward*.

And when a whole people walks together — with faith, hope, and charity dwelling in their hearts — the Lord calls them **Zion**.
