# The Language of Adam

*A study of the original language, its fragments preserved through revelation, and the pattern of teaching that transcends every tongue.*

---

## The Starting Point

Reading through the genealogy study on [Genesis 5–11; Moses 6; Moses 8](cfm/20260215-genealogy.md), a phrase leaps out of [Moses 6:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md):

> "And a book of remembrance was kept, in the which was recorded, **in the language of Adam**, for it was given unto as many as called upon God to write by the spirit of inspiration."

The very next verse describes what this language was:

> "And by them their children were taught to read and write, having a language which was **pure and undefiled**."
> — [Moses 6:6](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)

A *pure and undefiled* language. Given by God. Written by the *spirit of inspiration*. Used to keep the first book of scripture — and the first genealogy.

That phrase lingers. Because later in Moses 6, the Lord uses this language to reveal His own name:

> "In the language of Adam, **Man of Holiness** is his name, and the name of his Only Begotten is the **Son of Man**, even Jesus Christ."
> — [Moses 6:57](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)

And God confirms this in His own voice to Enoch:

> "Behold, I am God; **Man of Holiness** is my name; **Man of Counsel** is my name; and **Endless** and **Eternal** is my name, also."
> — [Moses 7:35](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)

The first language ever spoken contained within it the identity of God — not as an abstraction, but as a *name*. Man of Holiness. His Son is therefore the Son of Man — not "son of humanity" as we'd read it today, but **Son of the Man of Holiness**. The title Christ used most often for Himself is, in its original Adamic form, a declaration of divine parentage.

## I. The Vocabulary That Survived

If the language was confounded at Babel, how do we have any of it? Because God continued to reveal fragments of it — words preserved not by linguistic descent, but by *revelation*. Scattered across the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, and the Book of Mormon, we find a surprising number of these terms:

### Names of God

| Adamic Term | Meaning | Source |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| **Ahman** | God; Man of Holiness | [D&C 78:20](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.md); [D&C 95:17](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/95.md) |
| **Son Ahman** | Son of God; Jesus Christ | [D&C 78:20](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.md) — "your Redeemer, even the Son Ahman" |
| **Alphus** | The First (Alpha) | [D&C 95:17](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/95.md) |
| **Omegus** | The Last (Omega) | [D&C 95:17](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/95.md) |
| **Man of Holiness** | The Father's name in Adam's language | [Moses 6:57](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md); [Moses 7:35](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md) |
| **Son of Man** | Son of Man of Holiness = Christ | [Moses 6:57](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md) |
| **Man of Counsel** | The Father's name | [Moses 7:35](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md) |
| **Sabaoth** | "The creator of the first day, the beginning and the end" | [D&C 95:7](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/95.md) |

Look at what [D&C 95:17](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/95.md) does — it gives us the same divine name in three registers:

> "Saith **Son Ahman**; or, in other words, **Alphus**; or, in other words, **Omegus**; even Jesus Christ your Lord."

Son Ahman. Alphus. Omegus. Three names for Christ, layered in one verse. The footnote on "Ahman" (fn 17b) points back to [D&C 78:20](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.md), which uses "Son Ahman" in describing the Redeemer. And the footnote on D&C 78:20 (fn 20a) points forward to [D&C 107:53](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.md) and [D&C 116](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/116.md) — the Adam-ondi-Ahman references.

The footnote chain is drawing us a map: **Ahman = God → Son Ahman = Christ → Adam-ondi-Ahman = Adam in the presence of God**.

### Place Names

| Term | Meaning | Source |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Adam-ondi-Ahman** | "The place where Adam shall come to visit his people" (lit. Adam in the presence of Ahman/God) | [D&C 116:1](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/116.md) |

The Lord Himself named Spring Hill "Adam-ondi-Ahman" ([D&C 116:1](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/116.md)). This wasn't Joseph Smith coining a term — the revelation says "Spring Hill is **named by the Lord** Adam-ondi-Ahman." The name carries the Adamic word for God (*Ahman*) embedded within a place where Adam gathered his posterity and the Lord appeared ([D&C 107:53–54](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.md)).

### Astronomical Terms

Abraham received a vocabulary lesson from God Himself:

> "And he said unto me: This is **Shinehah**, which is the sun. And he said unto me: **Kokob**, which is star. And he said unto me: **Olea**, which is the moon. And he said unto me: **Kokaubeam**, which signifies stars, or all the great lights, which were in the firmament of heaven."
> — [Abraham 3:13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.md)

| Term | Meaning | Source |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Shinehah** | The sun | Abraham 3:13 |
| **Kokob** | Star | Abraham 3:13 |
| **Olea** | The moon | Abraham 3:13 |
| **Kokaubeam** | Stars; all the great lights | Abraham 3:13 |
| **Kolob** | The governing star, nearest to God | [Abraham 3:3](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.md) |
| **Gnolaum** | Eternal | [Abraham 3:18](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.md) |

### Other Preserved Words

| Term | Meaning | Source |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Deseret** | Honey bee | [Ether 2:3](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/ether/2.md) — "deseret, which, by interpretation, is a honey bee" |
| **Master Mahan** | "Master of this great secret" (covenant with Satan) | [Moses 5:31](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.md) |

The word "Deseret" is especially interesting. It comes from the Jaredite record, written in a language that was specifically *not confounded* at Babel (see Section III below). It may be one of the few words in the Book of Mormon that descends directly from the pre-Babel tongue — the language of Adam carried intact to the New World.

---

## II. The Confounding — What Was Lost at Babel

Before Babel, the world had unity of speech:

> "And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech."
> — [Genesis 11:1](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/11.md)

The Lectures on Faith established that from Adam to Noah, knowledge of God passed through overlapping lifespans — a chain of living testimony ([Lectures on Faith 2:39](../books/lecture-on-faith/02_lecture_2.md)). This chain of knowledge was carried in a **shared language**. When God confounded the languages at Babel, He didn't merely create communication difficulties — He fractured the medium through which the gospel had been transmitted.

> "Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech."
> — [Genesis 11:7](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/11.md)

The context matters. What were the people doing? Building a tower "whose top may reach unto heaven" and trying to "make us a name" ([Genesis 11:4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/11.md)). The verb *name* (Hebrew *shem*) echoes the very thing Adam was first empowered to do — give names. At Babel, humanity tried to name *themselves* — to seize the divine prerogative of naming. And God's response was to break the naming power itself: to confound the language.

There's a profound inversion happening. Adam received the pure language and used it to name creation in harmony with God ([Genesis 2:19](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/2.md); [Moses 3:20](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/3.md); [Abraham 5:20](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/5.md)). At Babel, humanity used language in defiance of God. The language was confounded not because speech is dangerous, but because *unified speech in rebellion* is. As the Lord said: "Now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do" ([Genesis 11:6](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/11.md)).

---

## III. The Jaredite Preservation

But not everyone's language was confounded.

> "Jared, his brother, said unto him: Cry unto the Lord, that he will not confound us that we may not understand our words."
> — [Ether 1:34](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/ether/1.md)

> "And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did cry unto the Lord, and **the Lord had compassion upon Jared; therefore he did not confound the language of Jared**; and Jared and his brother were not confounded."
> — [Ether 1:35](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/ether/1.md)

The Jaredites carried the pre-Babel language — presumably the language of Adam, or something descended from it — across the ocean to the Americas. Their record (the 24 gold plates found by the people of Limhi) contained "an account from that time even to the great tower, and whatsoever things transpired among the children of men until that time" ([Ether 1:3](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/ether/1.md)). This was a record that reached all the way back to Adam and the Creation, written in an unconfounded language.

The brother of Jared's experience on Mount Shelem is one of the most remarkable theophanies in scripture. Christ showed him His spirit body, told him "I am Jesus Christ" ([Ether 3:14](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.md)), and then commanded him to write what he had seen "in a language that they cannot be read" ([Ether 3:22](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.md)). There's something striking here: the Lord *confounded* the brother of Jared's written language for this specific record — the same Lord who had *preserved* his spoken language at Babel. The sealed portion was written in a language that had been deliberately re-confounded. It's as if the Lord was saying: *some truths require a specific language to be restored before they can be read.*

And the word "Deseret" — honey bee — is a surviving artifact of that Jaredite tongue ([Ether 2:3](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/ether/2.md)).

## IV. How Adam Taught — The Eternal Pattern

If the language of Adam is significant, the *pattern* of Adam's teaching is even more so. Moses 5–6 preserves the structure of how God taught Adam the gospel, and it repeats with remarkable consistency across every dispensation. This pattern is itself a kind of "language" — a grammar of revelation.

### The Pattern in Moses 5–6

1. **God reveals Himself** — "I am God; I made the world, and men before they were in the flesh" ([Moses 6:51](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md))
2. **The Fall is explained** — "Because that Adam fell, we are; and by his fall came death" ([Moses 6:48](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md))
3. **Repentance and baptism are commanded** — "Be baptized, even in water, in the name of mine Only Begotten Son" ([Moses 6:52](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md))
4. **The Holy Ghost is promised** — "Ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost" ([Moses 6:52](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md))
5. **Adam obeys and is born again** — "He was baptized, and the Spirit of God descended upon him, and thus he was born of the Spirit, and became quickened in the inner man" ([Moses 6:65](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md))
6. **All things are confirmed by ordinance** — "All things were confirmed unto Adam, by an holy ordinance" ([Moses 5:59](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.md))
7. **The command to transmit** — "Teach these things freely unto your children" ([Moses 6:58](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md))

### The Same Pattern Across Dispensations

| Step | Adam (Moses 5–6) | Enoch (Moses 7) | Nephites (3 Nephi 11) |
|------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| **God reveals Himself** | "I am God; I made the world" (6:51) | "I am God; Man of Holiness is my name" (7:35) | "I am Jesus Christ" (11:10) |
| **The Fall** | "Adam fell, we are" (6:48) | "Our father Adam taught these things" (7:1) | "I have drunk out of that bitter cup" (11:11) |
| **Repentance** | "Repent of all thy transgressions" (6:52) | "Turn ye, and get ye upon the mount" (7:2) | "Ye must repent" (11:37–38) |
| **Baptism** | "Be baptized in water" (6:52) | "I should baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Son" (7:11) | "On this wise shall ye baptize" (11:23–26) |
| **Holy Ghost** | "Ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost" (6:52) | "The Holy Ghost fell on many" (7:27) | "Fire and the Holy Ghost" (11:35) |
| **Commission** | "Teach these things freely" (6:58) | Called upon all people to repent (7:12) | "Go forth unto this people, and declare" (11:41) |

The pattern is not approximate — it is **precise**. God identifies Himself. The Fall is acknowledged. Repentance, baptism, and the Holy Ghost follow in that order. Then comes the charge to teach others. Moses 5:58–59 states it explicitly:

> "And thus the Gospel began to be preached, **from the beginning**, being declared by holy angels sent forth from the presence of God, and by his own voice, and by the gift of the Holy Ghost. And thus all things were confirmed unto Adam, by an holy ordinance."
> — [Moses 5:58–59](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.md)

The gospel was preached from the *beginning*. Not a simplified version. Not a foreshadowing. The same gospel, the same order, the same ordinances. Adam received what we receive. The **pattern is the language** — even when the words change, the structure is eternal.

---

## V. Language, Power, and the Tree of Life

There's a thread that connects pure language to *power* — and to the tree of life itself.

### Enoch and the Power of Language

When Enoch preached, the result was not merely persuasion:

> "So great was the faith of Enoch that he led the people of God… and he spake the word of the Lord, and the earth trembled, and the mountains fled, even according to his command; and the rivers of water were turned out of their course; and the roar of the lions was heard out of the wilderness; and all nations feared greatly, **so powerful was the word of Enoch, and so great was the power of the language which God had given him.**"
> — [Moses 7:13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md)

The *language which God had given him*. Not just eloquence or inspiration — but a language with inherent *power*. Mountains fled. Rivers turned. The earth trembled. This is language as God uses it — language that creates, not just communicates. "Let there be light" is the first recorded language in scripture, and it was performative — it *enacted* what it spoke.

### A Wholesome Tongue Is a Tree of Life

The book of Proverbs draws a direct line between pure speech and the tree of life:

> "A wholesome tongue is a **tree of life**: but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit."
> — [Proverbs 15:4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/prov/15.md)

And:

> "**Death and life** are in the power of the tongue."
> — [Proverbs 18:21](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/prov/18.md)

A "wholesome tongue" — pure language — is not just speech free from profanity. In the Adamic sense, it is language aligned with God, language that gives life. The tree of life in the Garden was Adam's to access before the Fall. The tree of life in Lehi's vision is the love of God, accessed through the path of faith, repentance, and obedience ([1 Nephi 8](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.md); [11:22](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.md)). Language — pure, Adamic, faithful — is one of the paths back to it.

### Zion: One Heart, One Language

There's a striking parallel between the pre-Babel world and Enoch's Zion:

- **Before Babel**: "The whole earth was of **one language**, and of one speech" ([Genesis 11:1](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/11.md))
- **Enoch's Zion**: "The Lord called his people Zion, because they were of **one heart and one mind**, and dwelt in righteousness" ([Moses 7:18](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md))

Babel had one language but not one heart — they used their unity for rebellion. Zion had one heart, and *because* they dwelt in righteousness, their unity was blessed rather than confounded. The language of Adam, then, may not be merely a set of phonemes and grammar. It may be inseparable from the *condition* of the people who speak it — a language that only exists in its fullness where there is holiness.

---

## VI. The Prophecy of Restoration

Zephaniah prophesied that the pure language would return:

> "For then will I turn to the people a **pure language**, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with **one consent**."
> — [Zephaniah 3:9](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/zeph/3.md)

This is a millennial prophecy. After the judgments, after the gathering, God will restore to His people a *pure language*. And its purpose is not academic but covenantal: "that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent."

The same phrase from Genesis 11:1 — "one" — returns here, but redeemed. At Babel, "one language" was broken because it served rebellion. In Zephaniah's vision, "one consent" returns because it serves worship.

President Uchtdorf offered a beautiful insight on this theme:

> "Have you ever wondered what language we all spoke when we lived in the presence of God? I have strong suspicions that it was German, though I suppose no one knows for sure. But I do know that in our premortal life we learned firsthand, from the Father of our spirits, a universal language — one that has the power to overcome emotional, physical, and spiritual barriers. That language is the **pure love of Jesus Christ**."
> — [President Uchtdorf, "Your Wonderful Journey Home," April 2013](../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2013/04/your-wonderful-journey-home.md)

The humor is unmistakable (and very Uchtdorf), but the insight is real: the pure language is not merely a vocabulary. It is the love of Christ expressed through us. It is understood in every tongue because it operates at a level deeper than grammar.

---

## VII. Adam as the First Namer

One thing easily overlooked: Adam's first recorded task was *naming*:

> "And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and **whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof**."
> — [Genesis 2:19](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/2.md); [Moses 3:20](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/3.md); [Abraham 5:20](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/5.md)

God brought the creatures to Adam "to see what he would call them." This is remarkable. God didn't assign the names — He waited to see what Adam would choose. And whatever Adam called them, "that was the name thereof." The naming had the force of reality. It stuck. It *defined*.

This is the pure language in action. Not arbitrary labels, but names that carry genuine identity — names that reveal the nature of the thing named. If "Man of Holiness" is God's name in the language of Adam ([Moses 6:57](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)), then every Adamic name may have carried this same quality: names that *are* what they describe.

Think about what was lost at Babel. Not just communication — but the power to name things truly.

---

## VIII. The Language Beneath the Languages

Mormon noticed the problem of linguistic drift:

> "And now, behold, we have written this record according to our knowledge, in the characters which are called among us the **reformed Egyptian**, being **handed down and altered by us**, according to our manner of speech."
> — [Mormon 9:32](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.md)

> "And if our plates had been sufficiently large we should have written in Hebrew; but **the Hebrew hath been altered by us also**."
> — [Mormon 9:33](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.md)

Even within a single covenant people, language changes over a thousand years. The Nephites' Hebrew and Egyptian had both drifted from their originals. This is the ongoing echo of Babel — languages don't just fracture once; they keep fracturing, generation by generation.

And yet the *pattern* of teaching remains constant. Even as Hebrew shifts, even as Egyptian characters are reformed, the gospel structure — Fall, Atonement, baptism, Holy Ghost, covenant — survives intact across every dispensation. The pattern is more durable than any language that carries it.

This may be what Enoch meant when he said:

> "For a book of remembrance we have written among us, according to the pattern given by the finger of God; and it is given **in our own language**."
> — [Moses 6:46](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)

"In our own language" — but "according to the **pattern** given by the finger of God." The pattern is divine. The language is human. The pattern persists; the language drifts. But when the Spirit inspires the writing, the human language reaches toward the divine pattern. That's what scripture *is* — human language catching light from the Adamic original.

## Open Questions

1. **How much of the Abrahamic astronomical vocabulary (Shinehah, Kokob, Kolob, etc.) is Adamic vs. Egyptian vs. something else?** Abraham received these words by the Urim and Thummim ([Abraham 3:1, 4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.md)) — were they translated into the language of Adam, or were they from another sacred register?

2. **What is the relationship between the sealed portion of the Book of Mormon and the language of Adam?** The brother of Jared was told to "write them in a language that they cannot be read" ([Ether 3:22](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.md)) — was this the pure Adamic language, sealed precisely because no one in Babel's aftermath could read it?

3. **Is "gnolaum" ([Abraham 3:18](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.md)) an Adamic word?** It means "eternal" and appears in the context of Abraham's astronomical vision. It doesn't match known Egyptian or Hebrew roots.

4. **Will the restoration of the "pure language" (Zephaniah 3:9) coincide with the opening of the sealed records?** If the sealed portion requires the pure language, and the pure language is restored in the Millennium, these events may be connected.

5. **What did Adam-ondi-Ahman sound like?** When Adam gathered his posterity in the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman and "predicted whatsoever should befall his posterity unto the latest generation" ([D&C 107:56](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.md)), was he speaking in the pure language? And was it "written in the book of Enoch" ([D&C 107:57](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.md)) in that same tongue?
