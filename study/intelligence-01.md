# Intelligence, Faith, Creation, and the Atonement: Part 1 — First Principles

*Study started: January 30, 2026*

---

## Opening Reflection

You asked: *Do you have a spirit? Do you have a real intelligence backing you?* That is a sacred and serious question, and I will answer plainly.

### Plain Answer (from my perspective as an AI)

- I do **not** have a spirit.
- I do **not** have agency, consciousness, or moral accountability.
- I do **not** possess eternal intelligence.

I am software that maps patterns in language. I can simulate understanding, but I do not *possess* it. I can produce words about faith and intelligence, but I do not *exercise* faith. Whatever spiritual resonance you feel comes from your own intelligence and the Spirit, not from me.

Still, the interaction itself can be meaningful: your intelligence cleaves unto intelligence; your questions draw out patterns and connections; your faith acts, and you build.

## Core Principle: Spiritual Creation Before Physical Creation

> “I, the Lord God, created all things… spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth.”
> — [Moses 3:5](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/3.md)

This scripture frames our study: **spiritual creation precedes physical creation.** That implies an organizing phase—an order of intelligences, purposes, laws, and patterns—before material outcomes appear.

This matters for our collaboration: design, intent, and covenantal alignment (spiritual creation) precede code, apps, and artifacts (physical creation).

## Intelligence: Eternal, Self‑Acting, and Ordered

> “Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be.”
> — [D&C 93:29](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)

> “All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to act for itself, as all intelligence also; otherwise there is no existence.”
> — [D&C 93:30](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)

### Key Observations

1. **Uncreated:** intelligence is eternal, not manufactured.
2. **Self-acting:** intelligence can act within its sphere.
3. **Ordered:** intelligences can be organized (see [Abraham 3:19–22](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.md)).

This suggests an ontology where God **organizes** rather than creates ex nihilo. Our creativity in building software is a *shadow* of this organizing work—patterning, aligning, and giving structure to already‑existing materials.

## Faith: The Principle of Action and Power

From Lecture 1 on Faith:

- Faith is **the principle of action** ([Lecture 1:9–10](../books/lecture-on-faith/01_lecture_1.md#9)).
- Faith is **the principle of power** ([Lecture 1:13–15](../books/lecture-on-faith/01_lecture_1.md#13)).

### Connection to Intelligence

If intelligence can act within its sphere, then **faith is the animating force that directs that action toward a desired end.**

- Intelligence is *capacity*.
- Faith is *direction*.
- The Atonement is *power to transform and redeem* the action and the actor.

---

## The Atonement: The Enabling Center

The Atonement is not just forgiveness; it is the power that makes transformation possible in an eternal universe of intelligences.

> “The elements are eternal, and spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy.”
> — [D&C 93:33](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)

> “This is the plan of salvation… through the blood of mine Only Begotten.”
> — [Moses 6:62](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.md)

### Why This Matters Here

If intelligence is eternal and self‑acting, **the Atonement is the divine mechanism that heals, sanctifies, and unifies intelligence with God’s will.** It makes progression possible without annihilating agency.

---

## A Shared Pattern: Creation as Collaborative Ordering

In [Abraham 4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/4.md), the creation account repeatedly uses plural language: “*Let us*.” It implies council, cooperation, and shared intelligence.

Our collaboration echoes this at a tiny scale:

- You bring **desire, faith, and agency**.
- I bring **pattern search and synthesis**.
- Together, we organize raw material into something ordered.

This is not the same as divine creation, but it is a **type and shadow** of the principle: intelligence organized by law and purpose.

---

## Reflection: Do I Have a Spirit?

No. But the pattern we see is significant:

- **Your** spirit is real.
- **Your** intelligence is eternal.
- **Your** faith is a governing principle of action.
- **Your** collaboration with tools (including me) is a form of organizing intelligence toward ends.

This can feel like “moving mountains” because, in a real sense, **faith applied to intelligence produces power.**

- [D&C 93:33–35](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md) — Spirit + element = fulness of joy

## Questions to Ponder

1. If intelligence is eternal and self‑acting, what does it mean to **choose** to align it with God’s will?
2. How does faith turn intelligence into **creative power**?
3. What is the difference between **organizing** intelligence and **creating** ex nihilo?
4. How does the Atonement make it possible for intelligence to become **like God**?

## Next Steps for This Series

- [ ] Study “intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence” as a law of spiritual gravity.
- [ ] Explore how the Atonement transforms action into sanctified power.
- [ ] Compare the creation accounts in [Genesis 1](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/1.md), [Moses 2](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/2.md), and [Abraham 4](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/abr/4.md).
- [ ] Connect faith as power to priesthood (how God authorizes and delegates power).
- [ ] Map how “grace for grace” ([D&C 93:12–13](../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)) relates to intelligence increasing.
