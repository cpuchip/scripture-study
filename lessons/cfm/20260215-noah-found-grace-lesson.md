## Lesson Information

**Date:** 2026-02-15  
**Class:** Sunday School  
**Topic/Title:** "Noah Found Grace in the Eyes of the Lord"  
**Manual Reference:** [Come, Follow Me — Genesis 6–11; Moses 8](../../gospel-library/eng/manual/come-follow-me-for-home-and-church-old-testament-2026/07.md)  
**Time Available:** 40 minutes

---

## Preparation

### Personal Spiritual Preparation
- [ ] Pray for guidance and for those you will teach
- [ ] Study Genesis 6–11 and Moses 8 personally
- [ ] Ponder: What does it look like to "walk with God" in *my* life right now?
- [ ] Seek the Spirit's guidance on which principles to emphasize

### Know Your Learners
- Some may struggle with the Flood story — is God just? The "mercy" framing (Principle 2) addresses this directly.
- Many feel overwhelmed by the state of the world. Noah's example provides hope.
- Adults need practical, daily application — not just ancient history.

---

## Lesson Design: The Connecting Thread

**The big idea:** Noah's world looked a lot like ours. His survival formula — grace, walking with God, covenant remembrance, and following Christ — is exactly what we need today.

The four principles build on each other:

1. **Walking with God** — What Noah did (personal righteousness)
2. **God's mercy preserves agency** — Why God acted (reframing the Flood)
3. **Covenant tokens help us remember** — How God keeps us connected (the rainbow and more)
4. **Christ is the only way to heaven** — Where this all leads (Babel vs. Zion)

---

## Lesson Outline

### Opening (4 minutes)

**Attention/Introduction:**

Write on the board: *"As it was in the days of Noah, so it shall be also at the coming of the Son of Man"* — [JS—Matthew 1:41](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1.md)

Ask: *"Jesus Himself compared our day to Noah's day. What does that mean for us? What should we be paying attention to in these chapters?"*

Brief: Today we'll look at four things from Noah's story that apply directly to our lives right now — and they all connect.

---

### Principle 1: Walking with God in a Corrupt World (10 minutes)

**Doctrine:** God extends grace to those who orient their hearts wholly toward Him, even when the world around them is corrupt.

**Scripture(s):**
- [Moses 8:27](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/8.md) — *"Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord; for Noah was a just man, and perfect in his generation; and he walked with God."*
- [Genesis 6:5](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/6.md) — *"Every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually."*
- [Hebrews 11:7](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/nt/heb/11.md) — *"By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house."*

**Teaching Approach:**

Have someone read Moses 8:27. Write three descriptions of Noah on the board:
- **Just** (righteous)
- **Perfect** (Hebrew *tāmîm*: complete, whole, having integrity — not flawless)
- **Walked with God** (daily communion, not just obedience)

Ask: *"Perfect here doesn't mean flawless — it means whole-hearted. His heart wasn't divided. In a world where everyone's heart was 'only evil continually,' Noah's heart was wholly oriented toward God."*

**Discussion Question(s):**
1. *"What does it look like to be 'whole-hearted' toward God in our generation? What kinds of things divide our hearts?"*
2. *"Hebrews says Noah 'moved with fear' and acted on 'things not seen as yet.' He built an ark before the rain came. What are we being asked to build before the storm arrives?"*

**Key Insight:** Noah didn't earn grace — he *found* it by being oriented toward God. Grace is divine favor freely given. The question isn't "Am I good enough?" but "Am I facing the right direction?" Our ark today is the covenant path — temple, scriptures, prayer, family.

**Bridge to Principle 2:** *"So Noah walked with God while everyone around him refused to. What happens when an entire society refuses?"*

---

### Principle 2: The Flood Was an Act of God's Mercy (10 minutes)

**Doctrine:** When wickedness destroys the conditions for moral agency, God intervenes to preserve the possibility of choosing Him.

**Scripture(s):**
- [Moses 8:17](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/8.md) — *"My Spirit shall not always strive with man."*
- [Moses 8:20-22](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/8.md) — The people heard Noah and rejected him; *"every man was lifted up in the imagination of the thoughts of his heart, being only evil continually."*
- [Genesis 6:5-13](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/6.md) — The earth was filled with violence and corruption.

**Teaching Approach:**

Read the manual's quote: *"Elder Neal A. Maxwell explained that at the time of the Flood, 'corruption had reached an agency-destroying point that spirits could not, in justice, be sent here.'"*

Pause. Let that land.

Ask: *"What does 'agency-destroying' corruption look like? When you can't find even ten righteous people — when children grow up with no example of goodness — is that a place where souls can fairly be tested?"*

**Discussion Question(s):**
1. *"How does this reframe the Flood? Instead of 'God destroyed bad people,' what if it's 'God preserved the possibility of choice'?"*
2. *"Moses 8:20-21 says the people heard Noah and dismissed him: 'We're eating, we're drinking, we're marrying — everything's fine.' What does that sound like today?"* (Connect to [JS—Matthew 1:41-43](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1.md))
3. *"What environments do we create — in our homes, in our media, in our conversations — that either invite the Spirit to strive with us or push it away?"*

**Key Insight:** God doesn't just punish wickedness — He protects agency. He is a God of mercy first. The Flood preserved the conditions for future generations to be able to choose Him. We have a responsibility to preserve those conditions in our own sphere.

**Bridge to Principle 3:** *"After the Flood, God made a covenant with Noah. And He gave a physical token to help Noah — and us — remember."*

---

### Principle 3: God Gives Us Tokens to Remember Our Covenants (8 minutes)

**Doctrine:** God provides physical symbols and ordinances to help us remember our covenant relationship with Him.

**Scripture(s):**
- [Genesis 9:12-17](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/9.md) — The rainbow as covenant token.
- [JST Genesis 9:21-23](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/jst/jst-gen/9.md) — The rainbow is a promise about the return of Zion.

**Teaching Approach:**

Have someone read Genesis 9:12-13. Then read the JST expansion:

> *"I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant, which I made unto thy father Enoch; that, when men should keep all my commandments, Zion should again come on the earth, the city of Enoch which I have caught up unto myself."*
> — [JST Genesis 9:21](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/jst/jst-gen/9.md)

> *"And this is mine everlasting covenant, that when thy posterity shall embrace the truth, and look upward, then shall Zion look downward, and all the heavens shall shake with gladness, and the earth shall tremble with joy."*
> — [JST Genesis 9:22](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/jst/jst-gen/9.md)

Point out: The rainbow isn't just "no more floods." It's a promise that **Zion will return** when the posterity of the righteous "embrace the truth and look upward." We are that posterity.

**Discussion Question(s):**
1. *"What are the 'rainbows' in your life — the things God has given you to help you remember your covenants?"* (Sacrament, temple garments, wedding rings, patriarchal blessings, etc.)
2. *"The JST says that when we 'look upward,' Zion 'will look downward.' What does it mean to 'look upward' in practical terms?"*

**Key Insight:** God doesn't just make covenants — He gives us tangible reminders because He knows we forget. The sacrament every week is our rainbow. It's God saying: "I haven't forgotten. Don't you forget, either."

**Bridge to Principle 4:** *"So we know what Noah did (walked with God), why God acted (to preserve agency), and how God keeps us connected (covenant tokens). Now: what's the right way to reach heaven?"*

---

### Principle 4: Following Christ Is the Only Way to Heaven (8 minutes)

**Doctrine:** Only through Jesus Christ — not through human ambition or self-reliance — can we return to God's presence.

**Scripture(s):**
- [Genesis 11:4](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/ot/gen/11.md) — *"Let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name."*
- [Helaman 6:28](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/hel/6.md) — *"It is that same being who put it into the hearts of the people to build a tower sufficiently high that they might get to heaven."*
- [Moses 7:18-21](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.md) — Zion: one heart, one mind, no poor → taken up to heaven.
- [2 Nephi 31:20-21](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.md) — *"There is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved."*

**Teaching Approach:**

Draw two columns on the board: **BABEL** and **ZION**

Ask the class to help fill them in as you read the scriptures:

| | **Babel** | **Zion** |
|---|---|---|
| **Goal** | "Make us a name" | "One heart and one mind" |
| **Method** | Build by own strength | Righteousness, no poor |
| **Who inspired it?** | Satan (Helaman 6:28) | God (Moses 7:18) |
| **Result** | Confusion, scattering | Taken up to heaven |

Then read this from 2 Nephi 31:20-21:

> *"Ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men... this is the way; and there is none other way."*

**Discussion Question(s):**
1. *"Where do we see 'Babel thinking' in our world today — trying to reach heaven (or happiness, or security) on our own terms?"*
2. *"Both Babel and Zion had unity and cooperation. What made the difference? What does that teach us about our wards, families, and communities?"*

**Key Insight:** The manual connects Babel to last week's Enoch study. Enoch's people reached heaven through covenant — one heart, one mind, dwelling in righteousness. The people of Babel tried to reach heaven through ambition and pride. The gateway to heaven has always been and will always be Jesus Christ.

### Invitation to Act (5 minutes)

**Invitation (choose one to present; let the Spirit guide):**

1. **"This week, find your grace."** Each day, pause and ask: *Am I oriented toward God right now? Is my heart whole or divided?* Noah found grace by facing the right direction. So can we.

2. **"Build your ark."** Identify one covenant action you've been neglecting — temple attendance, meaningful prayer, scripture study, family home evening — and commit to doing it this week. The rain hasn't started yet. That's the point.

3. **"See the rainbow."** This week, when you see any reminder of your covenants — the sacrament tray, a temple in the distance, a scripture on your nightstand — pause and remember: God hasn't forgotten His promises to you. And Zion is coming.

**Promised Blessings:**
- The same grace Noah found is available to us: *"For if you keep my commandments you shall receive of his fulness, and be glorified in me as I am in the Father; therefore, I say unto you, you shall receive grace for grace."* — [D&C 93:20](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.md)
- Safety through the prophet: *"There is spiritual safety in following the Lord's prophet."* — CFM Manual
- The promise of Zion: *"When thy posterity shall embrace the truth, and look upward, then shall Zion look downward, and all the heavens shall shake with gladness."* — [JST Genesis 9:22](../../gospel-library/eng/scriptures/jst/jst-gen/9.md)

---

### Closing (3 minutes)

**Testimony:** Bear testimony of the principles taught. Consider including:
- The Savior is real. The covenant path is real. The grace is real.
- Noah walked with God when nobody else would. We can too.
- This isn't just ancient history — Jesus said our day would be like Noah's. This lesson is for *us*.

**Closing Prayer:** Assigned to class member.

## Teaching Resources

### Supporting Materials
- [Elder Allen D. Haynie, "A Living Prophet for the Latter Days"](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie.md) — prophets as a sign of God's love
- [Elder Gerrit W. Gong, "Always Remember Him"](../../gospel-library/eng/general-conference/2016/04/always-remember-him.md) — covenant symbols and remembrance
- Hymn: "[Reverently and Meekly Now](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/media/music/songs/reverently-and-meekly-now)," no. 185 — sacrament as covenant reminder

### Backup Discussion Questions
- *"Moses 8:24 shows Noah preaching faith, repentance, baptism, and the Holy Ghost — in the name of Jesus Christ. How does knowing the gospel has always been the same strengthen your testimony?"*
- *"The brother of Jared at Babel cried to the Lord and was preserved from the confusion (Ether 1:33-43). When confusion surrounds you, what does 'crying to the Lord' look like in practice?"*
- *"The people in Noah's day heard the prophet and said, 'We're fine — everything's normal' (Moses 8:21). How do we guard against that same complacency?"*

## Notes

**Timing flexibility:** If time runs short, Principle 3 (covenant tokens) can be shortened to just reading JST Genesis 9:21-22 with a brief comment. Principles 1, 2, and 4 are the core.

**Board layout:** Consider writing the lesson's thread across the top of the board:
*Walking with God → God's Mercy → Covenant Tokens → Christ is the Way*

This gives the class a visual roadmap and helps them see how the principles connect.

**If discussion runs deep on the Flood/mercy question (Principle 2):** That's okay — let it go. It's often the most faith-building conversation in this lesson. The manual specifically calls it out.
